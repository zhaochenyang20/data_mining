The London-based designer Marc Newson is known for working in lightweight materials like aluminum, so the marble pieces, like the Extruded Chair, above, that he created for the Gagosian Gallery on West 24th Street represent a surprising turn toward heft. The show, running from next Thursday through March 3, includes limited-edition pieces priced from $70,000 to $400,000. Which may be a bargain. Across the street, Sebastian & Barquet will be featuring Mr. Newson's older pieces in a show opening the same day; the Lockheed Lounge, a chair of hammered metal, is priced at $2.5 million. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111; Sebastian & Barquet, 544 West 24th Street, (212) 488-2245.
