Days after saying he would represent himself at his trial on wiretapping, racketeering and conspiracy charges, Anthony Pellicano, below, the Hollywood private eye, has changed his mind. Mr. Pellicano is asking a federal judge to allow him to rehire Steven F. Gruel of San Francisco and to add a Los Angeles lawyer, Michael H. Artan. The request was first reported by The Los Angeles Daily Journal, which covers the courts. ''It's easier for two lawyers to handle a matter than one, and that's not a fact that would have escaped Mr. Pellicano,'' Mr. Artan said in a telephone interview yesterday. Mr. Gruel could not be reached for comment.
