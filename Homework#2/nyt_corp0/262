Mr. Gordon has rightfully earned a reputation as one of the premier trombonists of our time, primarily through a close association with Wynton Marsalis and Jazz at Lincoln Center. A superior technician with a gift for buoyant swing, Mr. Gordon, above, is a feel-good player, made of much the same stuff as the trumpeter Clark Terry. His new album, ''This Rhythm on My Mind'' (Bluesback), comes out of a partnership with Jay Leonhart, a bassist and kindred spirit. In addition to their lower-register meanderings, the album features breezy vocals and droll lyrics from both artists. Among the album's modest delights is ''Toast My Bread,'' a tune by Mr. Gordon laden with appetite and innuendo. (It has popped up on record once before, as a duet between Mr. Gordon and the pianist Eric Reed.) Mr. Gordon and Mr. Leonhart are regrouping on Wednesday at the Rubin Museum of Art, but their agenda will be loftier, and their collaboration less free-form. As part of its ''Harlem in the Himalayas'' series, presented in conjunction with the Jazz Museum in Harlem, the Rubin will be screening ''Intolerance,'' the epic 1916 silent film by D. W. Griffith, with a brand-new score by Mr. Gordon. His instrumentation will include two bassists, two keyboardists, two drummers and a hand percussionist; Mr. Gordon will play not only trombone, but also tuba, on which he is scarily proficient, and didgeridoo, on which proficiency may not be the point. The film's innovative narrative structure, which jumps among four historical periods, should provide Mr. Gordon with a useful compositional device. And its message -- a morally complex critique of social injustice, by the same director responsible for ''The Birth of a Nation'' -- seems likely to provoke Mr. Gordon's deeper passions. (Wednesday at 7 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, Ext. 344, rmanyc.org; $25.)
