WHO hasn't dreamed of a machine that works more muscles in less time? Look no further. The Orbital 360, which resembles a pair of ski poles mounted onto grapefruit-size spheres, has landed. Unlike most weight circuits, it offers resistance in multiple planes so that a variety of muscles are recruited at once. Used creatively, it can improve stability and balance.
That's the good news. The bad? The Orbital 360 can be awfully tricky at first. A gyroscopic wheel with a handgrip tops each pole. On my maiden voyage, we were asked to trace big sweeping circles while rotating our wrists. The exercise is as confounding as patting your head while rubbing your stomach. And unless you play tennis or golf, is wrist strength really the most pressing concern?
Clutching the poles allowed me to hold balancing poses longer, like Mercury Descending (a twisting lunge). Support also makes weight-bearing exercises safer, said Gregory Florez, a spokesman for the American Council on Exercise.
While physically taxing at times, the 20-minute class didn't keep my heart rate up. My thighs quickly fatigued doing Saturn's Rings, for instance, but I wasn't close to breathless. The grueling position requires lying on your back, toes through handles, legs extended far apart while making circles and scissor kicks.
Marilyn Calabrese, who stayed for a second session, said the Orbital 360 workout is not as ''rigorous as a sculpting class.'' But because it doesn't require an army of dumbbells, resistance bands and bars, there's less to schlep.
