The former mayor of Keyport pleaded guilty in Federal District Court yesterday to accepting $24,000 in bribes from contractors seeking city construction work, federal prosecutors said. The former mayor, John Merla, 45, admitted accepting the payments while in office in 2003 and 2004, said Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney for New Jersey. Mr. Merla was one of 13 Monmouth County officials arrested in February 2005 as part of a corruption investigation by federal agents. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 8 and faces up to 30 months in prison.
