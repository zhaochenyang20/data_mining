Governor Spitzer does not allow members of his administration to participate in political fund-raisers in Albany during the legislative session and has spoken about introducing legislation to ban such events. But they are still legal now, and with the coming budget season coinciding with prime time for the Albany fund-raising season, lobbyists are girding for three or more very expensive cocktail parties a night.
Take tomorrow: State Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Nassau County Republican, is having a $750-a-head fund-raiser atop the tallest building in Albany; Senator George H. Winner Jr., an upstate Republican, is having a $400-a-head fund-raiser at a club a few blocks from the Capitol; and Assemblyman James Tedisco, the Republican minority leader, is having a $300-a-head fund-raiser across the street from the Capitol.
The Democrats, of course, are not taking vows of poverty. A ''Save the Date'' notice went out last week inviting donors to a fund-raiser that Governor Spitzer is headlining for the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee. Donors are invited to reserve seats for as much as $10,000. But that party will not be in Albany: it will be 140-odd miles south, in Manhattan.
