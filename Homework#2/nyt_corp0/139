The producers of Douglas Carter Beane's new play ''The Little Dog Laughed,'' about a gay Hollywood star who is kept in the closet by his agent, have announced that the show will close after the matinee on Feb. 18.
The play, which cost a little more than $2 million and originally opened Off Broadway last winter at the Second Stage theater, will have played 22 previews and 112 regular performances at the Cort Theater on Broadway.
The likely prospect to move into the Cort is ''Radio Golf,'' the last of August Wilson's 10-part play cycle on the black experience in the 20th century.
