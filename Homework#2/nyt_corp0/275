To the Editor:
Re Paul Krugman's recent columns on health care reform (Jan. 1, 5 and 12):
We agree with Mr. Krugman that ''reform is in the air.'' While some think that Mr. Krugman's solution -- Medicare for all -- would help us address the problem of the uninsured, we believe that it's time for an energetic national debate on a broader range of options.
The latest Commonwealth Fund Health Care Opinion Leaders Survey recommends several other approaches to universal coverage. These include allowing individuals to purchase insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program or expanding current state-based public offerings. The California proposal is one of several at the state level, opening up the possibility of more decentralized reform.
The Mayo Clinic Health Policy Center recently convened a cross section of experts at the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy to address how to provide insurance for all Americans. The group's primary recommendation was to require individual ownership of insurance, with sliding scale subsidies available for people with lower incomes.
There is no doubt that many other innovative approaches exist. Enthusiastic, respectful dialogue will help us discern the best solution for our country.
