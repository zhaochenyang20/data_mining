To the Editor:
In ''Make Them Fight All of Us'' (column, Jan. 12), Thomas L. Friedman poses a real challenge to the Bush administration. He suggests an increase in the gas tax as a means of reducing our reliance on foreign oil imports.
As a World War II veteran, I recall the sacrifices that were asked of the public in the war effort, especially the rationing of gas for automobiles. That system was sensitive to the different requirements of the public, distinguishing between essential and nonessential driving.
History has shown that it was an extremely successful mechanism, not only in reducing gas consumption but also in the fairness by which it was applied. The economic status of the individual did not enter the picture as it would have by applying an additional tax.
I have long felt that the public was not given the opportunity to express its nationalism by sharing in the sacrifice of this war in Iraq. Gas rationing would certainly serve that purpose.
