An obituary on Jan. 11 by The New York Times Regional Newspapers about James C. Weeks, a former president and chief operating officer of The New York Times Regional Media Group, incorrectly described his postgraduate education. He was a graduate of the Program for Management Development at the Harvard Business School -- not a recipient of a master's degree in marketing from the University of Florida, where he earned his undergraduate degree. The obituary also misspelled the given name of his wife. She is Toney Weeks, not Toni.
