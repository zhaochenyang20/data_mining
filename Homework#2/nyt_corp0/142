Ségolène Royal, the Socialist Party's presidential candidate, said owners of unoccupied residences should be fined and even pressured to sell the properties to local governments as a way to ease homelessness. She also said that every city should be forced to create emergency shelters for 1,000 people. France's numerous vacant investment lodgings ''will have to be rented,'' Ms. Royal said in her New Year's speech yesterday in Paris, which was broadcast on national television. ''To do that, lodgings unoccupied for more than two years will be surcharged and local governments will be given the chance'' to acquire or requisition them. The latest opinion poll shows Ms. Royal leading Nicolas Sarkozy, the interior minister who is expected to be the candidate of the governing UMP party in the spring election, by 52 percent to 48 percent.
