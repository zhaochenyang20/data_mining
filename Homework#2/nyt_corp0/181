MUDICK--Bertram, passed away on January 2, 2008. Beloved husband of Gilda, loving father of Eric and Stephanie, grandfather of five adoring grandchildren, Dahlia, Lily, Jennifer, Alison, and Sara. Bertram Mudick was one of the most well respected individuals in the shoe industry for over 50 years. He had the foresight to project trends and merchandize brilliantly. His intensity and pulse for fashion was inspired by his worldwide travels. He was honored by the Swedish government for introducing to the United States Swedish designer and couture collections. Revolutionizing the merchandise concept in women's footwear was his game and passion. He brought the accessory business to a dominating new high through women's footwear.
