Perhaps the most famous construction crew in the city's history is down a man.
A figure of an ironworker has been stolen from a sculpture that stood at ground zero for five months and replicates a famous photograph of workers eating lunch on a steel beam high above the city, the police said.
The sculpture is a life-size depiction of the unattributed 1932 photograph, which shows a group of 11 ironworkers above the Rockefeller Center construction site.
The rightmost figure in the sculpture disappeared sometime between Sunday night and yesterday afternoon from outside the sculptor's studio on 47th Avenue in Long Island City, Queens, the sculptor said.
The sculptor, Sergio Furnari, 37, said he discovered it was missing yesterday when he went out to a truck that carries the sculpture, intending to drive it around Manhattan. He said the thieves had to have climbed up 12 feet just to get to the 100-pound figure, which was welded to a beam.
''It was something premeditated,'' he said. ''It wasn't a bunch of kids just passing by.'' Last night investigators were taking fingerprints at the scene.
Mr. Furnari worked for a year on the artwork, finishing a few weeks after Sept. 11, 2001. It resonated with the workers clearing ground zero, and was given a space near the viewing platform in May 2002, where it remained for five months before going on a coast-to-coast tour.
''The twin towers were made by the ironworkers, and it was the ironworkers that had to remove the whole steel out of ground zero,'' Mr. Furnari said.
''Those statues meant a lot after 9/11 for all New Yorkers,'' he said. ''It's American history. Those are the guys who built America. Part of me feels like, if they took that, they took a piece of New York City and American history.''
