Netgear's Dual-Mode Cordless Phone with Skype -- or the SPH200D for short -- mixes plain old landline communications with cutting-edge Internet calling.
The SPH200D connects to your standard phone line and allows traditional calls. It also hooks into your Internet router and works with Skype, the popular online calling service owned by eBay that allows free calls to other Skype users, who typically talk using headsets at their computers. You can talk to anyone on your Skype buddy list or make inexpensive national and international calls over Skype's network without having to use your own computer.
The phone includes a cordless handset that uses D.E.C.T. (digital enhanced cordless telecommunications) technology to reduce interference from other wireless networks and improve call quality. It also has a small color screen that shows a list of Skype contacts or caller ID information, depending on the network being used.
The phone is priced at $199 and is available now at major online and retail stores. Additional handsets are extra and will be available later this year.
