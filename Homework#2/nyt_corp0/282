New York City's unemployment rate dropped to 4.3 percent in December, the second-lowest level in the 30 years that extensive records have been kept for the city. The jobless rate, which is adjusted by the State Labor Department to account for seasonal fluctuations, was 4.5 percent in November after hitting a low of 4.1 percent in October. The number of private-sector jobs in the city increased by 45,500, or 1.5 percent, in 2006, the Labor Department reported. New York State's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4 percent in December, down from 4.2 percent in November. Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the data ''suggest that the economy may have decelerated a bit'' at the end of last year.
