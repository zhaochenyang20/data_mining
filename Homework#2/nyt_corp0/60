CINCOTTA--Joseph J., on January 13, 2007. Died peacefully in his sleep after a long illness, bravely borne, at age 83. He passed away at home surrounded by love and a devoted circle of friends. Beloved husband of the late Marion (nee Ferguson). Cherished father of Constance. Loving brother of the late Grace Baudhuin, Rose Deatherage and Mickey. Survived by nieces, nephews and extended family. He was a good friend and benefactor to many.
