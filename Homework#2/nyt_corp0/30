SHORTER daylight hours need not interfere with the comings and goings of runners, hikers and mountain bikers: a slew of new-and-improved headlamps can almost turn night into day.
In 2003, headlamp manufacturers started switching from using incandescent bulbs to high-out light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s. As L.E.D. technology has improved, options have multiplied. Users can choose the width of the beam their headlamp casts, how far it shines and the light intensity, said Jon Rockefeller, the sport division manager at Petzl, a leading headlamp maker.
