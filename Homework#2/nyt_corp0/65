JAY CARDIELLO likes to boast that N.F.L. Training is one of the ''toughest classes in New York.'' It's a bold statement (not to mention a cliché), but Mr. Cardiello, left, who created this high-energy workout to bring football to sideliners, isn't afraid to be bold: he is a private trainer for N.F.L. players and former conditioning coach in the Arena Football League.
The routine varies but it's often a nonstop mélange of 100 push-ups and jumping jacks, 20 squats and lunges, a series of hydrants, and 10 minutes of drills (like ''blocking'' someone with a body bar, or kicking an invisible ball à la Charlie Brown). It's tough, though I have certainly survived harder full-body workouts. The sweltering 83-degree heat heightens the intensity, but this football practice is really just a variation on a boot camp with some ''Hut huts!'' thrown in.
Mr. Cardiello may fancy himself a younger, less volatile Joe Paterno, but he is still prone to theatrics. At the beginning of the hour he yanks a curtain to seal off the room, so the group becomes an insulated unit. The music blasts --''We Will Rock You'' (surprise!) -- and for two minutes the team claps its hands and thumps its thighs. Why? Because ''I'm trying to bring out the beast within you,'' he explained. Oh.
During the cool-down, Mr. Cardiello utters profundities like, ''If you can do this class, then why the heck can't you make it in life?'' Then he whips open the curtain with a flourish.
