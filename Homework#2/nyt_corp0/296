Seven former guards and a nurse charged in the death of a 14-year-old boy at a boot camp in Panama City in January 2006 have pleaded not guilty. The guards and the nurse were charged in November with aggravated manslaughter in the death of the boy, Martin Lee Anderson. A security videotape from the camp showed the guards covering Martin's mouth, forcing him to inhale ammonia and striking him repeatedly after he stopped running on his first day at the camp. The nurse is seen on the tape watching the guards. The defendants face up to 30 years in prison if convicted.
