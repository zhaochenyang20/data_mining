An article on Jan. 4 about Delores Pryce, a Queens woman whose youngest daughter has health problems and who received help from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to help pay an electricity bill, referred incorrectly to New Alternatives for Children, a program that helps families with medically fragile children. (The error was repeated in an article on Jan. 5 about Dorcas Acheampong, a Bronx woman who received help from the fund to help pay her rent.) Although it is a member agency of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, it is not run by the federation.
