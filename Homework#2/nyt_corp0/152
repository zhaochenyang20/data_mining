KATZ--Ira. The family of Howard Katz (deceased), Gilda, Alan (Randi, Stefanie and Pamela), Stuart (Carmen, Andrea and Sandra) and Jonathan (Robin, Danielle and Derek), mourn the passing of his brother Ira. Ira and Howard, with their father Philip, were among the pioneers of housing and industrial construction on Long Island after WWII under the trade name of Sherwood. As patriarch, he delighted in the success and happiness of his family. His wonderful smile and warm, easy way made him the beloved family man we will always remember. Our love and thoughts are with his wife Elaine, son Jeffrey (Beth Rogers), daughter Suzi and his grandchildren (John, Jason and Mark). May his memory be for a blessing. So long, Tom.
KATZ--Ira, age 88, long-time resident of Hewlett, NY and Boca Raton, FL died on December 31, 2006 at his home in Hewlett, NY surrounded by his family. Beloved husband of 61 years to Elaine, loving father of Suzi Katz-Roth and Jeffrey (Beth Rogers) Katz, cherished grandfather of Mark (Amanda) Roth, Jason Roth and John Katz. He was born and raised in New York and graduated from New York University in 1939. During World War II, he served in the United States Army, first in North Africa then in the South of Italy. After the war, he, along with his father Philip and brother Howard, started Sherwood Equities, a real estate company that over the years built many single-family homes, apartment houses and industrial buildings across Long Island. His primary devotion, and by far, his most highly valued success, was always his family and his role as its patriarch. His love of family and friends and his wonderful sense of humor will be sorely missed by all.
