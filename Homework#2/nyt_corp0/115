It will be one week tomorrow since Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, introduced the iPhone, the company's long-awaited entry into the cellphone world. Since then, gadget reviewers waxed poetic about the iPhone's design; Cisco Systems, which makes a phone by the same name, filed a trademark infringement lawsuit; and Apple's stock hit a record high before closing Friday at $94.62 a share. All this happened against the backdrop of a federal inquiry into backdated stock options at Apple.
Now, it remains to be seen whether the iPhone can chip at the market share of the BlackBerry manufacturer, Research In Motion, or even Sharp, which introduced the Sidekick III in July.
