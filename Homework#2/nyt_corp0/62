Until Feb. 6 Columbus Circle will be the site of ''Home to the Future,'' a 45,000-cubic-foot exhibition on home-related technologies sponsored by Time Warner in the lobby of the Time Warner Center. The designer Edwin Schlossberg (inset) created the four-story scrim box housing the show, along with smaller spaces resembling a bedroom, a living room and a kitchen. He called the exhibition ''layered,'' saying it combined ''massive size'' with ''tactile interactivity'' to show how new technologies will soon shape homes. ''But while it is large, it is also quiet,'' he added, suggesting at least one change that New Yorkers can look forward to; 10 Columbus Circle; hometothefuture.com.
