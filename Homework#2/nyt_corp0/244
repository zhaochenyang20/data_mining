Edmund Stoiber, a leading conservative powerbroker and an ally and irritant to Chancellor Angela Merkel, said he would step down in September as Bavaria's prime minister and leader of the Christian Social Union, a sister party of Mrs. Merkel's Christian Democrats. Mr. Stoiber, the governor of Bavaria, Germany's largest state and its economic powerhouse, for almost 14 years, had been under attack from within his party as opinion polls showed his and the party's ratings sinking. Last month, he was forced to accept the resignation of his chief of staff after a party member critical of Mr. Stoiber accused the aide of snooping on her private life. The polls also shook Mrs. Merkel's party, which relies on the muscle of the Bavarian conservatives in federal elections.
