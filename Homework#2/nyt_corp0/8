The return of ''American Idol'' on Tuesday delivered record ratings for Fox, as 37.3 million viewers watched the series' sixth season premiere from 8 to 10 p.m., according to Nielsen's estimates. No other Fox premiere has ever garnered more total viewers; among adults 18 to 49, it tied the 1997 ''X-Files'' season debut. For the night, Fox outdrew CBS, NBC, ABC, and the CW combined by 78 percent in the 18-to-49 demographic. CBS was second over all, buoyed by ''NCIS'' at 8 (15.9 million). NBC ranked third as ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'' led at 10 (14.1 million). On Friday, the Disney Channel posted its second-most-watched day on record as ''Jump In!'' with Corbin Bleu (''High School Musical'') and Keke Palmer (''Akeelah and the Bee''), drew 8.2 million viewers, the most for a Disney Channel original movie. Following it, 7.6 million viewers tuned in for the premiere of ''Cory in the House,'' the best start for a Disney series.
