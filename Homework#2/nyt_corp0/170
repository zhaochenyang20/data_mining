VAN HENGEL--Maarten. The directors and members of the Netherland-America Foundation mourn the death of Mr. Maarten van Hengel, its former chairman and director. Maarten provided the building blocks and injected leadership into the Foundation in the early 1990s allowing the Foundation to grow into a vital pillar in the relationship between the United States and the Netherlands. Maarten's enthusiasm for, and commitment to, educational and cultural exchange between the two countries were exemplary and have inspired many current and former directors, members and contributors. His wisdom, guidance and support will be missed. We are grateful for Maarten's invaluable contributions and his friendship. We send our heartfelt condolences to Drusilla, the children and their spouses, all grandchildren and other members of the Van Hengel family on both sides of the Atlantic. On behalf of the NetherlandAmerica Foundation, Ennius E. Bergsma, Chairman
