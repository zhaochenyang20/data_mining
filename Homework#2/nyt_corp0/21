Re ''House Bans Smoking, and Few Complain'' (news article, Jan. 11):
The new leadership's ban on smoking inside the House of Representatives was more than a symbolic gesture indicating that ''the days of smoke-filled rooms in the Capitol are over.''
It was also a concrete action strengthening one of the most important tools recognized by public health to prevent addiction to tobacco -- and that is to make smoking socially unacceptable.
Smoking is the largest preventable cause of premature death in the United States (responsible for 1 of every 5 deaths), killing some 438,000 Americans annually. With help from Congress, we can end the days of smoke-filled rooms everywhere in America.
