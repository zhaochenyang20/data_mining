In a move to expand beyond the search business in the world's second-largest Internet market, Google has made an investment in Xunlei NetworkTechnology, a Chinese Internet video firm, the company said. A Google spokesman said that the investment in Xunlei would be announced today in Beijing, but he declined to give details. According to wire services, the China Daily reported that Google will team up with Ceyuan Ventures, a venture capital firm in Shangai, to buy a stake in Xunlei, which is in Shenzhen. According to the reports, Xunlei's Web site attracts more than 50 million visitors a day and more than 80 million users have downloaded its software. The Xunlei deal would be Google's second in as many days in China. Google is also teaming with China Mobile, that country's largest mobile telecommunications carrier, to deliver search services to cellphones.
