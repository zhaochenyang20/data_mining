To the Editor:
Re ''Noises Off: Playgoers Sip, Munch and Crunch'' (Weekend section, Jan. 5):
As an avid theatergoer, I was so dismayed at how many Broadway theaters allow eating and drinking during performances -- and all in the name of profit.
I can't tell you how many times I've been stuck next to a person eating loudly while I'm trying to listen to a song or a quiet scene; it's distracting to the audience, and as Patti LuPone stated, to performers as well.
And now, I'm not even justified in my complaints because theater management encourages this behavior.
To the people who say, ''If we're paying $100 or so for a ticket, we can do what we like,'' I say, ''I've spent $100 for my seat, and I should be able to enjoy live theater without listening to wrappers crinkling.''
