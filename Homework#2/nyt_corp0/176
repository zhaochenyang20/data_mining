Saying that it was ''not mulch ado about nothing,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced the opening of 66 sites this weekend where New Yorkers will be able to drop off Christmas trees for recycling into wood chips. During the 11th annual MulchFest, the sites, available on the city's Web site, nyc.gov, and on 311 will accept trees from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. tomorrow and Sunday. Many of the sites will be equipped with chippers, allowing the public, even those who come fir-free, to carry home mulch, officials said. Mr. Bloomberg cautioned that only trees and wreaths cleaned of decoration, and not in plastic bags, would be accepted, saying, ''No fruitcakes, Christmas socks or Hanukkah gelt.''
