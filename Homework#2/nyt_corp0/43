In his annual State of the City address, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday highlighted several cultural priorities for the city over the next year. He cited the restoration of the American Museum of Natural History's historic West 77th Street facade, above, and said that the city was also planning a major renovation of the New York Aquarium near Coney Island and construction of an educational museum for the Society for the Preservation of Weeksville and Bedford-Stuyvesant History, in Brooklyn. The mayor also estimated that two events -- the Armory Show and the Art Show of the Art Dealers Association of America -- would draw 60,000 visitors to the city next month.
