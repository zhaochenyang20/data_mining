This late in the game the reality show is as comforting in its genre structure as a 1920s-style murder mystery: formulaic, but what fun when applied to different settings. Bravo's ''Top Design,'' which begins Jan. 31 at 11 p.m., puts 12 interior designers together in a setup that's part ''Project Runway,'' part ''Survivor.'' Teams are assigned by paint chip (contestants pick colors and are matched with those who choose the same ones), and the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles is their island. In each of 10 episodes, they'll be set an interior design task to pass or fail, until their numbers are winnowed down to one. Todd Oldham, top, strangely wooden and seemingly not allowed to ad-lib on the first night, is the host. The judges are looser and harsher: from left, a charming Jonathan Adler; the beauty-queen-lovely Kelly Wearstler; and a feline and appealingly severe Margaret Russell, in whose magazine, Elle DÃ©cor, the winner will appear. Starting Feb. 7, ''Top Design'' will be broadcast at 10 p.m.
