KRAAR--Ronald. The leadership and staff of the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science mourn the passing of Dr. Ronald Kraar, beloved brother of our Executive Vice President Martin Kraar. We salute Ronald Kraar's distinguished career and devotion to his patients in his optometric practice. He was a wonderful brother, husband, father, and proud grandfather, and will be missed deeply by family and friends. We send heartfelt condolences to his wife Jeannette, to Marty, and to the entire family. As Ron's life was a blessing, so may his memory be.
