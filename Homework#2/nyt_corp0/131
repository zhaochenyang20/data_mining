Gov. Charlie Crist named Chief Walter A. McNeil of the Tallahassee police as secretary of the State Department of Juvenile Justice. Anthony Schembri, a former New York City commissioner of corrections, held the post under former Gov. Jeb Bush and was in charge a year ago when Martin Lee Anderson, 14, died a day after being admitted to a juvenile boot camp in Panama City. In November, seven guards and a nurse were charged with manslaughter in connection with Martin's death. Mr. McNeil, a Democrat, said he would balance prevention and treatment programs with punishment.
