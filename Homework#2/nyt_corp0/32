There's nothing like being in the middle of the action in a good video game. Serious fans of flight-simulator programs can now grab their force-feedback joysticks and practically climb right into the cockpit. The HotSeat Flight Sim gaming chassis, available in three models, brings both a Dolby 5.1 six-speaker surround sound system and a comfy chair to the stimulating experience of simulated flight.
Made of welded steel with an adjustable seat and flat-panel monitor stand, the HotSeat Flight Sim stows the subwoofer under the seat and offers plenty of table space for a keyboard, joystick and game controllers. The chassis is compatible with PC-based games and most major gaming systems, including the Nintendo Wii, Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation.
All models can be seen and ordered at hotseatinc.com. Prices for the Flight Sim chassis start around $1,000 for an entry-level rig and move up to $4,000 for a deluxe model that adds a 23-inch widescreen monitor, souped-up gaming PC, game controllers and a copy of Microsoft Flight Simulator X. Dramamine not included.
