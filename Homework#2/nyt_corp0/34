INSPIRED by the quirky tables made of roots or tree trunks that were popular in Adirondack camps in the early 20th century, many contemporary designers are creating new pieces, often from reclaimed wood. The wood -- found fallen in the forest or floating in streams -- may be chiseled or sanded into squares or egg shapes. These eccentric tables mix well with modern furniture and are an easy way to warm up spare interiors.
For those who prefer the older pieces, there are plenty of opportunities to find vintage tables in Manhattan this week. This winter's week of Americana antiques shows begins today.
The American Antiques Show, which benefits the American Folk Art Museum, opens at the Metropolitan Pavilion, 125 West 18th Street (where it continues though Sunday). The Winter Antiques Show, benefiting the East Side House Settlement, opens tomorrow at the Seventh Regiment Armory at 67th Street and Park Avenue (and continues through Jan. 28). Antiques at the 69th Regiment Armory (26th Street and Lexington Avenue) opens tomorrow and runs through Sunday. And Americana at the Piers (55th Street and 12th Avenue) will also be open this Friday and Saturday.

PERSONAL SHOPPER
