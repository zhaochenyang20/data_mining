The sound of downtown New York is mellow and lush. At least that is the sound that prevails in the network of small clubs on the Lower East Side that cater to a new generation of singer-songwriters that includes Kaki King, Vienna Teng and Ane Brun, and to soft-touch indie-folkers like Ollabelle, above, and Hem. These musicians cherish the tranquillity and intimacy of acoustic instruments, and while most are regular sights at tiny, no-cover rooms like the Living Room on Ludlow Street, they rarely have opportunities for big-statement shows at New York's major clubs and concert halls. But in a showcase tomorrow that is part of the annual Association of Performing Arts Presenters conference, they will be banding together for a high-profile gig at the Bowery Ballroom, a convenient opportunity to take in some of the cream of this flourishing scene. Ollabelle, a quintet of two women and three men, worships blues, country and gospel with crystalline voices, playing traditional songs like ''John the Revelator'' and originals that connect them to classic roots-rock. Hem, the best-known act, surrounds the luxurious alto of Sally Ellyson with countryish and equally luxurious arrangements. Ms. King, who began her career busking in subway stations, is a rarity: a virtuosic guitarist who prefers to keep her technique subtle, in the service of a style that is gracefully experimental. Ms. Teng is from San Francisco, and Ms. Brun is a Norwegian who lives in Sweden, but both have done their time on the small stages of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Ms. Teng's sentimental piano ballads have a lucidness that Ms. Brun's Nick-Drake-in-a-breathy-haze songs avoid, but both are played with a loving finesse and are as mellow as can be. (Tomorrow at 7 p.m., 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, 212-533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15.)
