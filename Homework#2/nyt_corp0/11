IT was only a matter of time before watered-down martial arts classes (see: kickboxing) evolved. After all, anyone can strike a virtual partner; it takes talent to do it with finesse. ''If you ever watch a karate movement, they're not just moving forward and back, there's showmanship there,'' said Bishop Garland, the creator of Street Kata. ''They move with grace and balance.''
This class blends elements from tae kwon do, shodokan aikido, capoeira and tai chi with serious dance moves. Imagine ''The Karate Kid Goes Break Dancing.'' Street Kata, according to a class description, is about ''understanding movement, which flows into understanding self.'' What that means remains a mystery, but we were asked to visualize clocking an unseen opponent in the knee, kidneys and head with swift kicks. Then we blocked, ducked, punched; eventually Mr. Garland strung moves together into choreographed sequences, until we had a fairly involved dance routine going.
The instructor has three rules: stay on the balls of your feet to avoid injury, keep your guard up and never stop moving. They're good precepts, applicable to life and gym. Forty-five minutes later I was wiped out. Did I understand myself any better? Not really, alas. But trying to figure out the moves -- and do them with a certain Ã©lan -- made the class flow right by. Best of all, Mr. Garland provides earplugs, so you don't have to feel like the loud, throbbing music is bashing you in the head along with an imaginary foot.
