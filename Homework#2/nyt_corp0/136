A Far Rockaway man was charged with raping two young women at Queens motels after taking them there on the pretense of being a police officer, prosecutors said. The man, Eric McCoy, 37, stopped a 27-year-old woman on Dec. 4, planted a packet of what appeared to be marijuana in her bag and threatened to arrest her if she did not accompany him, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Then, on Tuesday, he stopped a 17-year-old, told her that he was an investigator and said she needed to accompany him for questioning, Mr. Brown said. Mr. Brown said that Mr. McCoy forced the women to have sex with him under threat of being arrested. He was held pending arraignment on charges of rape, criminal impersonation and other offenses.
