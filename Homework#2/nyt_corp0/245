Two Atlanta D.J.'s arrested Tuesday night and charged with racketeering after agents raided their recording studio and confiscated 81,000 mixtapes were released on Wednesday on signature bonds, said Uwonda Carter, the lawyer representing Tyree Simmons, who works under the name DJ Drama. Mr. Simmons and Donald Cannon, a protégé and fellow member of the Aphilliates Music Group, have each been charged with one felony count of violating Georgia's Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organization Law for selling copyrighted music under their Gangsta Grillz label. No pleas were entered, and no further court dates were set, said a clerk for the Fulton County Superior Court.
