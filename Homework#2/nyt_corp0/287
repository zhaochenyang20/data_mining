A city housing official was charged with two counts of rape and one count of official misconduct yesterday after the authorities said he forced his way into the apartment of a woman and assaulted her. The official, Albert Foster, 44, of Somerset, who works as a Section 8 housing inspector, surrendered to the police yesterday, said Paula T. Dow, the Essex County prosecutor. Investigators said Mr. Foster was inspecting a Chadwick Avenue apartment building on Dec. 14 when he attacked a 31-year-old woman who lives there. After the assault, the victim contacted police, Ms. Dow said. Mr. Foster was being held at the Essex County jail yesterday afternoon. Information on bail was not immediately available.
