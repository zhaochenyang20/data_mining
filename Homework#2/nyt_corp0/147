Italy's culture minister, Francesco Rutelli, stepped into a festering controversy yesterday over Mel Gibson's violent new film, ''Apocalypto,'' after the national ratings board voted not to restrict the admission of minors. With the film (which is rated R in the United States) scheduled to open today in Italy, Mr. Rutelli asked the distributor, Eagle Films, to send letters to theaters to ''discourage'' the entry of unchaperoned minors. Eagle responded by saying it would ask theater owners to exercise discretion but that no child would be denied admission.
