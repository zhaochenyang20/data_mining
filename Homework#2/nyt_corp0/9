A New York couple were arrested yesterday and charged with money laundering and receiving stolen property for using slot machines in Atlantic City to launder embezzled money, said Stuart Rabner, the New Jersey attorney general. The woman, Jamine Alabre, 26, of Westbury, and her companion, Mathurin Ambroise, 33, of Queens were indicted by a New Jersey grand jury this week. The couple are charged with laundering $500,000 in stolen cash through Atlantic City casinos from January to October 2005, prosecutors said.
