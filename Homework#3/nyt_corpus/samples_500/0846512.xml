        <p>When President Boris N. Yeltsin declared on Thursday, somewhat prematurely as it turned out, that he had persuaded China to sign a treaty banning nuclear weapons testing forever, he was unaware of China's position on the "asteroid threat" and the need for "peaceful nuclear explosions" to combat it.</p>
        <p>The Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, told Mr. Yeltsin that China favored concluding a treaty this year. On the basis of his statement, Mr. Yeltsin announced what he thought was very good news, especially after President Clinton had personally requested that he try to win Chinese support for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</p>
        <p>China made its position clear before and after a meeting between the two leaders -- but not during the meeting.</p>
        <p>"The door to peaceful nuclear explosions should not be closed, at least not now," the Foreign Ministry said the day before Mr. Yeltsin's arrival for three days of meetings in China.  And, again, after Mr. Yeltsin asserted that China had been won over, the Foreign Ministry quickly deflated that news, declaring that its reservations stand.</p>
        <p>No one can quite understand it, but China is arguing that mankind needs to keep developing "peaceful" nuclear weapons in case a giant asteroid is discovered careering through space on a collision course with the earth.</p>
        <p>"Only China is thinking about the future of mankind," said a European diplomat here, rolling his eyes, as he repeated the Chinese argument that nuclear detonations might be needed on -- or above -- the planet.</p>
        <p>Beijing's stand may delay the signing of what would be one of the most important final steps in the control of nuclear weapons. The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has suggested that a fitting venue for a historic signing ceremony of the nuclear test ban treaty would be Hiroshima, Japan, site of the first wartime detonation of an atomic weapon.</p>
        <p>China emphasized the asteroid idea but said that nuclear weapons might also come in handy for other projects like: digging long tunnels or channels for irrigation, or creatinghuge reservoirs to store oil underground or water above ground; they might also be used to combat global climate changes or threats humans have yet to experience -- like killer asteroids.</p>
        <p>Astronomers know of about 200 asteroids that are likely to cross the Earth's  path sometime in the ages ahead and are looking for more, estimating that there  are perhaps as many as 1,700 whizzing through the solar system that could wreak  global havoc by exploding with the force of a million nuclear weapons or more. However, the chances of such a collision anytime soon are slim; they occur perhaps once every 300,000 years or so.</p>
        <p>Some weapons scientists in the United States have argued that rocket interceptors should be made ready to nudge doomsday rocks off course with a nuclear blast, but they have generally been ignored, with a consensus favoring better searches of the heavens to gauge the potential threat.</p>
        <p>Of course, any weapon that could shoot down an asteroid might have military utility as an anti-satellite weapon, something China has hinted it would develop if the United States, Japan and Taiwan build ballistic missile defense systems around China's periphery, as each nation has begun to discuss.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration and Congress are in agreement about the need to develop ballistic missile defenses in Asia. Japanese leaders have delicately explained to Beijing that they are looking at the "feasibility" of such a defensive network. Such systems would depend heavily on satellites.</p>
        <p>China's representative at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, Sha Zukang, in late March spelled out China's call for an exemption to the test ban  treaty. "No country can impose its will on China under any circumstances," he said.</p>
        <p>But China's reluctance to move forward comes at a time when Beijing is harboring deep suspicions about American intentions and about future military cooperation between the United States and Japan.</p>
        <p>In a rather startling assertion last week, the official Communist Party newspaper, The People's Daily, asserted: "The strategic objective of the United  States is to dominate the world." It went on to say that that the United States  "will not tolerate the emergence of a strong nation on the Eurasian landmass that would threaten its dominant position."</p>
        <p>Some Western officials say China is nurturing a "grievance strategy" toward the United States and is holding the test ban negotiations hostage as Beijing awaits the outcome of several confrontations with Washington over human rights,  copyright piracy by Chinese industries and illicit Chinese assistance to Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.</p>
        <p>"China does not appear to be in the mood to conclude any kind of agreement with the United States until things unfold further," said one Western diplomat.  Until then, he said, there is likely to be more talk of the need for nuclear weapons to control asteroids.</p>

        <p>Chinese-Russian Border Pact</p>
        <p>SHANGHAI, April 26 (By The New York Times) -- The Presidents of Russia and China and representatives of three other nations signed an agreement here today  to secure borders in Central Asia, and underline the bonds between Moscow and Beijing.</p>
        <p>Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan also signed the pact, which spells out steps to avoid conflict, specifying that each nation must inform a neighbor about any major military exercises or movements within 60 miles of a border.</p>
        <p>For China, drawing attention to its improving relations with Russia and its Asian neighbors is an easy way to tell Washington that Beijing has other options in seeking allies.</p>
        <p>Since there have been no serious border clashes in recent years, however, the agreement was more a declaration among friends.</p>
        <p>At one point, Mr. Yeltsin compared Chinese Communists, his new best friends,  with Russian Communists, his bitter rivals: "Our Communists are fanatics; Communists here are pragmatists."</p>
        <p>When he came to Shanghai, Mr. Yeltsin brought his political campaign with him. The Chinese were happy to stage a series of photo opportunities almost guaranteed to play well back in Russia, where elections are scheduled for June.</p>
