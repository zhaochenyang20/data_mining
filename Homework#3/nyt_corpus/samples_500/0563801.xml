        <p>I have never seen the conflict between the Croats and Serbs characterized as "white on white" violence. Why must racial terms be used here? The South African Government may want to paint a picture principally in terms of skin color, but I wonder why the American news media must be a party to that effort. NATHANIEL R. JONES</p>
