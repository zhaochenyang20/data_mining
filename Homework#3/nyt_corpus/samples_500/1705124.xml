        <p>ALEXANDER -- Grace George. The Board of Directors, staff, and artists of Studio in a School note with sorrow the passing of Georgie Alexander. A tireless and dedicated advocate for children and the arts, Georgie was instrumental in helping to choose the artists and teachers with whom Studio initially worked and has continued to be supportive both in spirit and financially. Studio is as much Georgie's legacy, as it is anyone's. We extend our sympathies to her daughter Jane and to her entire family.
