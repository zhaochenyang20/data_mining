        <p>LEAD: The rebel unit flagged down the local bus in northern Nicaragua and summarily ordered the male passengers to get out.</p>
        <p>The rebel unit flagged down the local bus in northern Nicaragua and summarily ordered the male passengers to get out.</p>
        <p>Then, without further explanation, the guerrillas gave the order: the men would follow the rebels to a contra camp. The women were told to get on their way, according to several witnesses and human-rights officials.</p>
        <p>The mass kidnapping two months ago near the town of Siuna is one of several reports of forced recruitment of civilians by the American-backed rebels, known as contras, in recent months. It is a politically damaging practice that Reagan Administration and rebel officials have repeatedly pledged to stop. A Tale of Misery</p>
        <p>Most of the 15 to 20 men taken from the bus escaped in the following nights during a forced march through the jungle. But for Omar Navas, who says he was too slow and too afraid to escape -and also for his family - the kidnapping on April 27 was the beginning of a miserable experience that has not yet ended.</p>
        <p>Mr. Navas told his story to this reporter in a rebel camp on the Honduran-Nicaraguan border last month. The reporter then traveled to Nicaragua, where he found Mr. Navas's parents, who had believed their son to be dead. They celebrated the news that he had been seen alive, and they spoke of their experience with a conflict that has destroyed their lives.</p>
        <p>Their story offers a human measure of the unsought war and bitterly contested revolution in Nicaragua that have split communities, killed tens of thousands, and wrecked the lives of countless people like the Navas family. 'I Want to Go Home'</p>
        <p>''Can you help me?'' Mr. Navas quietly asked as Sandinista rockets exploded near a contra border camp during a major attack last month. ''I want to go home.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Navas, 35 years old, could not walk. His bandaged feet were swollen like grotesque melons to twice their normal size because of a congenital problem with walking and cuts that became infected after a 21-day march with his contra kidnappers in the San Jacinto regional task force.</p>
        <p>A former schoolteacher, Mr. Navas recently became an accountant in a state-owned lumber yard, a job he took to earn more money for his family. He seemed an unsuitable candidate for guerrilla war: In addition to his inability to walk properly, he is in poor physical shape and has a young family, and he appears to have no strong political views. Parents Hear Their Son Lives</p>
        <p>''I am not at all political, and I told them when they took me that I could not walk properly,'' Mr. Navas said, breaking into slow tears. ''I have a wife, I have two young daughters -what will happen to them without me?''</p>
        <p>Three weeks later, Mr. Navas's aging parents expressed reactions that were as deeply felt in their impoverished home in a working class neighborhood of Managua.</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Navas, 78, had just come home after being hospitalized for an acute nervous disorder brought on, his wife said, by his anxiety at losing Omar, his eldest son and the family's breadwinner. They had heard nothing of him since the rebel patrol took him away. 'He Knows Nothing About War'</p>
        <p>''God brought this news to us,'' cried Mrs. Navas, 57, as she held her husband, Aristides. ''All of us have prayed for him these weeks to be alive, but we didn't know. God gave Omar back to us - he knows nothing about war.''</p>
        <p>The contras also kidnapped Antonio Rodriguez from the same bus traveling between the villages of Siuna and Rosita, according to his family and human-rights officials. Mr. Rodriguez was not seen by a reporter, but people in a rebel camp said he is also being held in a border base near the Bocay and Coco rivers.</p>
        <p>Human-rights officials estimate that at least 400 Nicaraguan families have, like the Navas family, had a relative kidnapped by the American-backed rebels. The practice now appears to be on the rise again as rebel units infiltrate Nicaragua anew and look for new recruits.</p>
        <p>A State Department official, asked by telephone to comment on the practice, said, ''We oppose kidnapping people, and we've made that clear to the rebels.'' Kidnapping Was 'an Error'</p>
        <p>The official appeared not to have been informed of the contra kidnappings reported to be occurring in Nicaragua despite a $3 million United States human-rights monitoring program for the rebels.</p>
        <p>A senior rebel commander, Mike Lima, was asked why his men were still seizing people. The question was especially pointed as 30 peasants had just walked into the border camp in what appeared to be a genuinely voluntary decision to fight the Sandinistas they said they oppose.</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. Lima described the kidnapping as ''an error,'' in which a young patrol commander had made the mistake of taking Mr. Navas and others to a secret rebel camp. There, he said, the senior commander ordered that the kidnapped men be held, rather than release them and risk disclosure of the rebels' location.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Navas's feet were soon in such bad shape - a condition he says kept him from being drafted into the Sandinista army - that the rebels had to carry him in a sling for the last four-days of a march to a hidden base on the border, according to Mr. Lima. More Suffering for the Navases</p>
        <p>The effect of the kidnapping on Mr. Navas's family and their community offers a sharp example of how the tactic of forcing people to fight hurts guerrillas in wars that depend on popular support.</p>
        <p>The Navas family had already suffered at the hands of the Sandinistas because of the contra war. The family ran the village store in San Carlos on the Coco river until 1981, when the Sandinistas decided to destroy the town and remove its inhabitants, suspected of supporting Miskito Indian rebels.</p>
        <p>Mr. and Mrs. Navas say they lost almost everything they owned. Mr. Navas, then 72, spent eight days in a State Security cell until the Sandinistas decided that he was not a contra.</p>
        <p>The Sandinistas then put the couple into a grim relocation camp where, the Navases said, their children persuaded officials to let them take their parents to Managua. So Much Ill Fortune</p>
        <p>The Sandinistas, who destroyed the couple's means of earning a living, have given them no assistance, Mrs. Navas said. She and her husband live off their children, eating beans and rice and wearing threadbare clothes and worn tennis shoes without laces.</p>
        <p>Then, after so much ill fortune, the contras seized their son.</p>
        <p>''We are old people, and there is nowhere left for us to go,'' Mrs. Navas said. ''The Government moved us, and now the contras have taken Omar. There has been so much suffering.'' Their kidnapped son's wife and two children still live in Siuna, in the northern war zone. The family now worries that with their son's continuing absence, his family will soon have little to live on.</p>
        <p>According to a number of witnesses, the effort at forced recruitment by the contras has done nothing to improve their already tarnished reputation in Siuna, where a rebel unit slit the throats of two agricultural consultants in 1985, according to a resident. Mr. Navas's Release Is Sought</p>
        <p>Contra commanders told a reporter that Mr. Navas would be free to return to Nicaragua if he chooses, and a rebel human-rights official said there ''is an effort being made'' to see that Mr. Navas goes home. United States officials are aware of the case and are reportedly seeking Mr. Navas's release as well. But so far he has not appeared.</p>
        <p>The last time a reporter saw him, Mr. Navas was sitting with bandaged feet in a small rebel base with almost 3,000 Sandinista troops preparing to attack. If the base was overrun, he would not have been able to flee. He had waved goodbye as a reporter left the base.</p>
        <p>Mr. and Mrs. Navas have asked international relief officials for help, but they are very worried and say they do not know what to do next. Their plight is shared by hundreds of Nicaraguan families and will be shared by more in a war in which there appears to be no clearly defined mechanism for returning prisoners or refugees from guerrilla control.</p>
        <p>The Sandinistas refuse to grant even minimal official recognition to the contras, making any exchange of prisoners or refugees in guerrilla hands especially difficult.</p>
