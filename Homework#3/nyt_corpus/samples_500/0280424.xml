        <p>LEAD: The Government today intensified its crackdown on demonstrators protesting apartheid in advance of Parliamentary elections scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The Government today intensified its crackdown on demonstrators protesting apartheid in advance of Parliamentary elections scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The biggest response was unleashed in Cape Town, where hundreds of police using water cannon, purple dye, batons and rubber whips charged hundreds of protesters marching toward Parliament and arrested about 500 people, including more than 50 journalists covering the march.</p>
        <p>Among those detained was the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. Most of those held were released on their own recognizance by this evening but faced charges.</p>
        <p>Today's tensions were alleviated by the incongruity of several incidents described later by journalists and other witnesses. 'You Had Better Disperse'</p>
        <p>During the melee that erupted on Adderly Street in downtown Cape Town, one unidentified youth climbed up on the water cannon spraying dye and tried to turn the nozzle away from the crowd. When the police tried to grab him, he got away. But part of the building housing the provincial headquarters of the governing National Party was dyed purple, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>The South African Press Association reported that a policeman put his hand over the lens of a video camera and shoved back the operator, only to realize that he belonged to one of the police video teams taping the demonstrators.</p>
        <p>And in Soweto, the largest black township outside Johannesburg, a police major at the site of the intended rally wistfully asked several clergymen whether everyone would prefer to go home to watch a championship rugby match being broadcast an hour later on television. Rugby is especially popular among white South Africans.</p>
        <p>This evening, the South African Press Association quoted a police spokesman, Lieut. Col. J. H. Labuschagne, as saying that nearly 1,000 people had been arrested throughout South Africa since Friday night. They included the 500 people arrested in Cape Town today and 300 students at the University of Natal arrested after a demonstration Friday.</p>
        <p>Heavily armed black soldiers were deployed in Soweto around an open-air stadium in the neighborhood of Jabulani to help the police prevent a rally called by the South African Council of Churches. ''They have conveyed a message that if you don't want blood, you had better disperse,'' said the Rev. Francois Bill, a senior official at the Council of Churches. Protesters Sprayed With Dye</p>
        <p>The Council has helped organize a Standing for the Truth Campaign to highlight injustices faced by the country's 28 million blacks, who are excluded from voting in the election.</p>
        <p>The authorities had previously banned the events in Cape Town and Soweto and legal challenges of the decisions were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>Violence broke out after more than 1,000 demonstrators moved through downtown Cape Town in two separate marches. Their way was barred by a phalanx of police who ordered them to disperse and then waded into the processions swinging batons and whips. Some police officers also fired tear gas. An unknown number of marchers were reported wounded, with some requiring medical attention.</p>
        <p>The demonstration marshals, who were identified by their red arm bands, were taken away first. Some of the marchers dropped to their knees and were dragged to police vans. Others tried to run but were knocked down by blasts from a water cannon, which sprayed the demonstrators with purple dye to identify them for arrest. 'We Shall Be Free'</p>
        <p>Those who later regrouped in St. George's Anglican Cathedral at the head of Adderly Street were told by a Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu that all the moral right was on their side.</p>
        <p>''We have committed ourselves to this struggle until it is won,'' the Archbishop was quoted as saying by the South African Press Association. ''We shall be free, all of us together, black and white.</p>
        <p>According to a police count, 52 journalists, including television crews, photographers and reporters, were detained for about three and a half hours. Restrictions in effect under the current national state of emergency decree require that journalists immediately leave any scene where unrest has broken out or looks likely to do so.</p>
        <p>The journalists detained in Cape Town included a television crew from the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which has given prominent coverage to official criticism of the civil disobedience campaign but very little to the demonstrations themselves.</p>
        <p>In Soweto, about a hundred people drifted from the vicinity of the prohibited rally to hold a brief service in a nearby Catholic church. Several dozen white policemen flicking stiff whips called sjamboks surrounded the church and ordered the occupants, who included perhaps a dozen clergymen and nuns, to leave at once. Journalists were also ordered away.</p>
        <p>This morning, the Citizen, a daily newspaper with close ties to the Government, reported that the police were rounding up the leaders of the Mass Democratic Movement, an alliance of anti-apartheid groupings that has emerged to direct the protests over the last month. The Citizen said 17 of the leaders had been arrested or detained and that 13 others were being hunted.</p>
