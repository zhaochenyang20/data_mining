        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re "Why the Philippines Exports Its Children" (letter, April 1): While the Philippine population growth rate "is one of the highest in the world," as George Raymond Tyndall says, it is too sweeping to conclude that that is the main problem in the Philippines. Nor should anyone make too much of the conflict on this question between the Roman Catholic Church and the Government.</p>
        <p>The main problem in the Philippines is underdevelopment, in which the so-called Filipino elite thrives, and consumerism, a system in which even the lowly spade that our people can make is imported. The main problem is a lack of basic industrialization.</p>
        <p>When it is considered that there are in a school year some 17 million students, the equivalent of the population of Australia, and that we graduate tens of thousands of professionals every year, for most of whom there are no jobs commensurate to their skills and talent, you begin to understand the exodus of Filipinos abroad -- from doctors and nurses, to engineers and architects, from jewelers to maids. The exodus is caused not by the population growth rate but by an underdeveloped economy. NICASIO G. VALDERRAMA New York, April 1, 1995</p>
