        <p>LEAD: Richard Fitzpatrick has become a full-time couch potato, courtesy of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
        <p>Richard Fitzpatrick has become a full-time couch potato, courtesy of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzpatrick is spending 17 weeks in bed as part of a study to determine the effects of long-term weightlessness and the extent of progressive loss of bone mass suffered by astronauts.</p>
        <p>The 45-year-old man, a former purchasing agent for a local business who was recruited for the study, has been on his feet only a few times since the third week of August. He said standing up has caused dizziness, leg cramps and a funny feeling in his feet. Low Pay, Little Work</p>
        <p>For reading library books, watching television, eating snacks and taking it easy on his hospital bed, Mr. Fitzpatrick is paid $187.60 a week.</p>
        <p>For NASA, the study is a vital to its effort to learn about the ability of humans to adapt to space, particularly for the long periods envisioned under the agency's planned space station program.</p>
        <p>''It's one of the important questions for the space station right now,'' said Dr. Victor Schneider, co-director of the study. ''If you have astronauts up for three months, you want to know if they recover and the effects over their careers.''</p>
        <p>The longest period United States astronauts have spent in space was 84 days during the Skylab 4 mission in 1974. In their time in orbit, the astronauts lost 4.5 percent to 7 percent of their bone mass, Dr. Schneider said.</p>
        <p>''All those who lost bone in Skylab were still down about that amount of bone five to seven years later,'' he said. Questions on Bone Loss</p>
        <p>Researchers believe long-term bed rest affects bones in much the same way space flight does, but remain unsure what causes bone mass loss over time.</p>
        <p>Scientists also say they are not sure whether humans ever regain bone mass lost in space.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schneider believes recovery is possible through exercise, although a 10-week study at Methodist Hospital with one astronaut, William E. Thornton, has indicated that stretching or bicycle riding does not help.</p>
