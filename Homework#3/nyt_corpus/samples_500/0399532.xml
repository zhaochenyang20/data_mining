        <p>Philip R. Michael, the director of New York City's Office of Management and Budget, is the orchestrator of the city's campaign to slash and burn its way through agency budgets to close a budget gap of more than $1.6 billion for the coming fiscal year.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Michael's demeanor may not be abrasive, his policies often are. Several former staff members say he angered senior budget officials soon after he arrived by promising to rid the office of what he said was its arrogance toward other agencies. Unpopular by Definition</p>
        <p>At the same time, some officials contend that Mr. Michael has not grasped the details of the city's budget, losing battles with other city department heads because he did not have the numbers to back up his arguments.</p>
        <p>And he is vilified regularly by the city's union leaders, who resent his efforts to block labor settlements that they have been seeking in negotiations.</p>
        <p>"He is limited in his thinking," said Barry Feinstein, the head of local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. "He is unimaginative. Hecomes with a bias against public employees. He thinks that the first thing you do with a problem is lay off the public work force."</p>
        <p>What has become clear to Mr. Michael since he took the $104,500-a-year post in January is that, as one former Koch administration official said recently, it is "not a job for somebody who wants to be liked."</p>
        <p>Yet at a time of increasingly bleak fiscal news, the budget chief is emerging as one of the most important officials in city government. In the months ahead, his recommendations will be central to whatever plans the Dinkins administration formulates.</p>
        <p>"The risks are very high," Mr. Michael said in an interview. "None of us want to have the prospect of losing control over the city's management. Clearly that is a risk right now."</p>
        <p>Mr. Michael, who is 50 years old, said he intended to reshape the office. Four of its five deputy budget directors have left since his arrival, and former staff members say morale is low. Mr. Michael admits he is "somewhat isolated" from his 450 staff members.</p>
        <p>"I have not wandered in and out of the offices as much as I should have," he said.</p>
        <p>Management and Budget has often been viewed as an elite department, attracting some of the most promising and best educated employees. A staff member works about two or three months of overtime a year, although "burnout" is common and the turnover high, Mr. Michael said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Michael, while praising the talents of his staff, said the days of its high-handedness towards other city agencies had ended. Yet he has not been timid about going into other city departments to clean house.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Michael took over the Finance Department under Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1980, he cut about 90 percent of the top staff, some 25 people, in his first two months in the job.</p>
        <p>"When I got here it was almost like the fox in the chicken coop," he said of his arrival at the Office of Management and Budget. "I had certain predispositions about O.M.B. I thought O.M.B. needed to be changed. The main change is that they should have an appreciation about how agencies work. They had an arrogant attitude that things had to be done because they said so, and this didn't sit well with me."  Eschewing 'Micromanagement'</p>
        <p>"If O.M.B. ever lost an issue, it was a real slap in the face," he said, "and it finally got to a point where O.M.B. never lost an issue.</p>
        <p>"If you reach a point where you end up winning every single argument, you get careless with the arguments you present," he said, "and I think a lot of that happened."</p>
        <p>Mr. Michael said he wanted to turn the office from "a micromanagement number-crunching operation, where we catch the agencies at every turn," to an office that works "with them to improve the way they run their agencies."</p>
        <p>He also said he did not believe that his job required him to master every detail of the budget. That view puts him at odds with many of his predecessors, who prided themselves on knowing the intricacies of the city's finances.  Fiscal Constraints</p>
        <p>Mr. Michael acknowledges that the the city's fiscal problems may undermine his desire to build bridges with city agencies.</p>
        <p>"Even when you try to understand and be nondictatorial as far as the agencies are concerned and give them the opportunity to manage themselves, when you are in a terrible budget crisis all you can do is say cut, cut, cut," Mr. Michael said. "I am not sure you end up being viewed any differently.</p>
        <p>"Eventually," he added, "people hear the bad news so often and get so depressed by it that you get blamed for the bad news. That is territory that goes with the job."</p>
        <p>In the last few years, Mr. Michael said, rising city revenues lulled Management and Budget into becoming lax on how money was spent.</p>
        <p>"Every bad decision that agencies made, or blown initiatives that cost you a lot of money, got totally covered up by the fact that every time you looked into the till you had more money than you expected to find," he said. "This covered up an awful lot of bad management."  Father and Coach</p>
        <p>Mr. Michael, a father of three, lives in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where he coaches in the South Riverdale Little League. He was born in San Francisco and received bachelor's and law degrees from the University of California at Berkeley. A former Justice Department trial lawyer, he went to work for New York City in 1972 as a deputy police commissioner for trials.</p>
        <p>At the Police Department, he discharged 256 police officers and fought a generous police pension plan that allowed officers to retire on full salary when they suffered certain illnesses -- what Mr. Michael considered minor ailments -- or heart attacks.</p>
        <p>After serving as a deputy commissioner in the city's Department of Investigations and as finance commissioner, he left public office briefly in 1984, when he joined Merrill Lynch &amp; Company as an investment banker. He then became general counsel to Sanus Health Systems, a health maintenance organization, in 1986. By 1989, however, he was back in government as director of the State Financial Control Board when David N. Dinkins chose him to head the city budget office.</p>
        <p>"Those were not good years," Mr. Michael said of his time in the private sector. "They were very oriented simply towards how much money could be made. I found that a lot of things I was called on to do, for which I got paid pretty well, were pretty trivial."</p>
