        <p>ARTHUR MILLER PREMIERE</p>
        <p>The premiere of Arthur Miller's new play "Broken Glass," opens at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven March 9, with previews beginning on Tuesday. Ron Rifkin, Amy Irving and Ron Silver have the leading roles, and John Tillinger is the director. Rounding out the cast of six are Frances Conroy, Lauren Klein and George N. Martin.</p>
        <p>The title was taken from Kristallnacht, or night of the shattered glass, when a 48-hour pogrom took place throughout Germany, in which Jews, their homes and businesses were destroyed on Nov. 9 and 10, 1938. It brought to a head the systematic persecution of Jews that began with a 1933 law dismissing them from government service and from the universities, and prohibiting them from entering the professions.</p>

        <p>ARTHUR MILLER PREMIERE</p>
        <p>The premiere of Arthur Miller's new play "Broken Glass," opens at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven March 9, with previews beginning on Tuesday. Ron Rifkin, Amy Irving and Ron Silver have the leading roles, and John Tillinger is the director. Rounding out the cast of six are Frances Conroy, Lauren Klein and George N. Martin.</p>
        <p>The title was taken from Kristallnacht, or night of the shattered glass, when a 48-hour pogrom took place throughout Germany, in which Jews, their homes and businesses were destroyed on Nov. 9 and 10, 1938. It brought to a head the systematic persecution of Jews that began with a 1933 law dismissing them from government service and from the universities, and prohibiting them from entering the professions.</p>
        <p>"Broken Glass" is set in Brooklyn in 1938, where Sylvia and Phillip Gelburg, portrayed by Ms. Irving and Mr. Rifkin, struggle with a mysterious paralysis that has overtaken her and is somehow connected to events taking place in Germany. Ron Silver plays the doctor to whom they turn for help and who becomes deeply entangled in their lives.</p>
        <p>Performance times are Tuesday at 7 P.M., Wednesday through Friday at 8 P.M., Saturday at 4 and 8:30 P.M., and Sunday at 2 and 7 P.M. Tickets are $24.50 to $34; preview tickets are $19 and $21. The box office number is 787-4282. CELEBRATING TIBET</p>
        <p>Beginning on Tuesday, the Venerable Lobsang Samten, a Tibetan Buddhist monk, will spend a month creating a multicolored sand mandala, six feet in diameter and two inches deep, on the floor of the Windener Gallery in the Austin Arts Center of Trinity College in Hartford. Visitors are welcome to watch him work, Monday through Friday from 10 to 4. When the mandala is completed it will be ceremoniously swept up and disposed of in the Connecticut River.</p>
        <p>The project is central to a series of events continuing through March 24, exploring the sacred arts of Tibet. The idea evolved from a request by Elena Fischbacher, a senior at Trinity, to include the making of a mandala, the symbolic circular design that is used in religious art and meditation, as part of her thesis on Tibetan Buddhist art forms.</p>
        <p>The month-long celebration was organized with the assistance of a new Tibetan refugee community in Old Saybrook. A reception will be held on Monday from 4 to 6 P.M. for the Venerable Lobsang Samten and his assistant.</p>
        <p>Some of the subsequent events include a lecture on Tuesday at 8 P.M. by Marilyn Rhie, a professor at Smith College, on "The Mystic Realm: The Mandala in Buddhist Art," and on Saturday from noon to 4 P.M. a full-blown Tibetan bazaar will take place, replete with merchants, arts and crafts demonstrations, concerts and dance performances.</p>
        <p>"The Mystical Arts of Tibet: Sacred Music, Sacred Dance" will be performed on Saturday at 8 P.M. by the monks of Drepung Loseling Monastery in the college's Goodwin Theater. Admission will be $8, or $5 for students and the elderly. Most other events are free. The number for a complete schedule is 297-2199. MUSEUM GUIDE</p>
        <p>One of the Connecticut Historical Society's contributions to black history month is a just-published guide to some 1,200 objects, books and other reference material in its museum and library at 1 Elizabeth Street in Hartford.</p>
        <p>The guide, which took two years to complete, is called "An Annotated Guide to Sources for the Study of African-American History in the Museum and Library Collections of the Connecticut Historical Society." It contains 251 pages listing photographs, textiles, toys, cartoons, children's books, prints, letters, account books and advertising cards, among other resources.</p>
        <p>It is the first such guide to be published by the society and is available for $20 in the society's bookstore. A copy is accessible to the public in the library for a fee of $3, or free to society members and to students with identification. The number for more information is 236-5621. MAPLE SYRUP TIME</p>
        <p>Warrups Farm in West Redding will be open to visitors during the first three weekends in March for the making of maple syrup. Each Saturday and Sunday Bill Hill, the farmer, will be in the log sugarhouse cooking the sap and making syrup and candy from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.</p>
        <p>Visitors who happen to arrive when the sap is running may trudge around outdoors to some of the 200 trees being tapped, viewing a process for collecting the liquid the easy way -- by gravity. Trees located on a hillside discharge sap into tubes that run down the hill and empty into tubs.</p>
        <p>Tracking the weather for warm sunny days and chilly nights is the way to predict a good sap-running day. Fresh syrup and maple sugar candies will be for sale, and the farm keeps a number of barnyard animals, many of which are amenable to petting. There are ducks, geese and turkeys, a donkey, sheep, pigs and Scottish Highland cattle.</p>
        <p>Mud boots are essential, whether tramping out to the trees or traversing the 125-foot path of snow-softened earth from the dirt road to the sugarhouse. The address is John Read Road, 1.2 miles north of Redding Center, off Route 107 and opposite the Redding Country Club. Admission is free and the phone number for more information is 938-9403.</p>
        <p>Anyone interested in sugarhouses elsewhere in the state can write to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Marketing Division, State Office Building, 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, 06106, for a free 1994 guide to 200 sugarhouses. Enclose a stamped, self-addressed legal-sized envelope. MAKING CAREER CHOICES</p>
        <p>Girls of middle school age and their parents are invited to take part in a career workshop offering a total of 17 workshops, from which each participant may choose three. The event, titled Choices Unlimited, is scheduled on Saturday from 8:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. at Central Middle School in Greenwich. Two of the workshops are geared for adults, focusing on how to help girls make career choices and financial planning for college.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the session is to encourage middle school girls to investigate the opportunities open to them, paving the way for an informed selection of courses in high school. Among the 17 careers to be discussed are architecture, banking, television production, publishing, journalism, chemistry, engineering, medicine and graphic design. Each presenter is a professional in his or her field who brings some of the tools of the trade to demonstrate, whether a veterinarian, an interior designer or a fitness trainer.</p>
        <p>Sponsors include the Greenwich Board of Education, League of Women Voters, American Association of University Women, National Organization for Women, and others. Admission is $3 and advance registration is recommended. For more information, 629-1554. ELEANOR CHARLES</p>
