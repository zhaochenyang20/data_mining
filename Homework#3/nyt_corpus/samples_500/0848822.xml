        <p>Speaker Newt Gingrich and his loyal No. 2, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, returned fire today at criticism leveled against the policies and practices of the House Republicans they lead. They were not, however, responding to some partisan salvo from Democrats but to the rather blunt criticism last week from Alfonse M. D'Amato, New York's Republican Senator.</p>

        <p>Speaker Newt Gingrich and his loyal No. 2, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, returned fire today at criticism leveled against the policies and practices of the House Republicans they lead. They were not, however, responding to some partisan salvo from Democrats but to the rather blunt criticism last week from Alfonse M. D'Amato, New York's Republican Senator.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. D'Amato complained that Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, was being hurt by his association with Mr. Gingrich. Today, Mr. Gingrich said Mr. D'Amato was "just wrong."</p>
        <p>I don't know why he is wandering around saying these things," Mr. Gingrich  said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."</p>
        <p>On another talk show, Mr. Armey, the House Republican leader, was far harsher, suggesting a motive for Mr. D'Amato: that the Senator was trying to shore up his political standing in New York, where he faces re-election in two years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich, returning to the talk-show circuit after an absence of several  months, used the occasion to attack President Clinton as well. On the balanced budget, he said Mr. Clinton "postures, says things that are false and has zero interest in a real agreement."</p>
        <p>And in vetoing a bill that would ban certain late-term abortions, Mr. Gingrich said, "Bill Clinton has taken an extraordinarily extreme position, that it is O.K. to kill children in ways in which no American could tolerate if they  knew about them."</p>
        <p>David Eichenbaum, communications director of the Democratic National Committee, said: "Nasty Newt is back, and he's nastier than ever. The better the economic news, the nastier Newt gets."</p>
        <p>With polls showing Mr. Dole trailing President Clinton by wide margins, it has been a season of discontent for Republicans with the sprouting of intraparty feuds.</p>
        <p>But unlike the disagreements among Republicans over issues like the minimum wage and the gas tax, the D'Amato-Gingrich argument is over how Mr. Dole should  shape his case to be President and how closely he should be identified with Mr.  Gingrich's aggressive approach.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato is a leading figure in the Dole campaign, and his criticism reverberated throughout Republican circles. His complaints that Mr. Gingrich misread his mandate from the 1994 elections were explicit and frequent in New York on Friday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich said: "I would simply say to Al D'Amato that we favor balancing  the Federal budget so that our children aren't crushed by debt. I think 80 percent of the American people favor that." He said most people also endorsed the House Republican efforts to enact death penalty laws and tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Armey, speaking on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," said Mr. D'Amato's "mama apparently didn't teach him not to bite the hand that feeds him." He said the Contract With America, the House Republicans' campaign manifesto from 1994, gave the Republicans majorities in both the House and the Senate, making Mr. D'Amato chairman of the banking committee.</p>
        <p>"I'm sorry he doesn't recognize that," Mr. Armey said. "But he's behind in the polls, and you know when politicians get behind in the polls they get desperate, and Al obviously wanted to endear himself to big labor. They're spending a ton of money in New York."</p>
