        <p>Fredric William Tokars, a lawyer and former prosecutor in Atlanta, was found guilty today of murder in the shotgun slaying of his wife, Sara Ambrusco Tokars, in front of her children in November 1992.</p>
        <p>The jurors deliberated about 10 hours on Friday and today before deciding that Mr. Tokars had planned the slaying. He could receive the death penalty; testimony in the sentencing phase of the trial will begin on Sunday. The trial is being held here, between Atlanta and Chattanooga, Tenn., because of pretrial publicity.</p>
        <p>The prosecution said Mr. Tokars had paid Eddie C. Lawrence, a former business associate of Mr. Tokars and a drug dealer, to kill his wife. Mr. Tokars had bought a $1.75 million insurance policy on his wife's life. Mr. Lawrence has told investigators that he hired another man, Curtis A. Rower, to carry out the slaying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tokars, an ambitious lawyer, was once a prosecutor and a judge.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Tom Charron, painted Mr. Tokars as a cold-hearted, selfish man who had planned the brutal slaying of his wife in detail so  she would not divorce him and take away his assets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tokars was convicted in 1994 on Federal racketeering and money laundering charges, which included arranging the death of his wife. He has already been sentenced to life in Federal prison without parole.</p>
        <p>Before her death, Mrs. Tokars had apparently discovered that her husband was involved in laundering drug money. She told friends that she was considering leaving Mr. Tokars, but was afraid to do so.</p>
        <p>On the day of the slaying, the Tokars' two boys, Rick and Michael,  were kidnapped along with Mrs. Tokars by the man who became their mother's killer. With the boys, then 2  and 6, in the back seat of a car, the killer shot Mrs. Tokars in the head.</p>
        <p>Rick, the oldest child, testified in Mr. Rower's trial. The boy broke down on the witness stand as he recalled how he had watched his mother plead for her life with ''a mean man.'' The lawyers agreed to use the transcript of that testimony in Mr. Tokars' trial rather than ask the boy to relive the killing again by testifying.</p>
        <p>In a plea bargain, Mr. Lawrence pleaded guilty to a murder charge, got a life sentence and agreed to testify against Mr. Tokars. Mr. Rower was convicted of kidnapping, robbery and assault, but the jury deadlocked on a murder charge. A new trial is planned.</p>
