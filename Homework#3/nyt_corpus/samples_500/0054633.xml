        <p>LEAD: The ''Highlights'' ballet program was popularized, if not invented, as a genre by the Bolshoi Ballet when the company from Moscow made its American debut in New York in 1959.</p>
        <p>The ''Highlights'' ballet program was popularized, if not invented, as a genre by the Bolshoi Ballet when the company from Moscow made its American debut in New York in 1959.</p>
        <p>Oddly, this format, with its mixture of excerpts, has been disparaged in recent years as an incoherent collection of bits and pieces, supposedly incapable of showing off a company's range. How wrong this can be was demonstrated with electrifying emphasis Saturday afternoon and evening at the Metropolitan Opera House: the ever-terrific new young Bolshoi dancers repeated, with some variations, the previously reviewed ''Highlights'' program of Friday night. Nerves had obviously dissipated - everyone danced better!</p>
        <p>Lyudmila Semenyaka continued to hold the Met audience in the palm of her hand, this time with a monstre sacre type of performance in the ''Don Quixote'' pas de deux with Irek Mukhamedov, who gratifyingly revealed himself as an excellent and controlled classical dancer - anything but the mere athlete his spectacular jumps have connoted in contemporary works. His own performance in the first-act ''Spartacus'' excerpt Saturday night was now more powerful the second time around than on Friday.</p>
        <p>Unlike the full version of the ballet to the Khachaturian score, this opening act had seemed anticlimactic on its own. On Saturday afternoon, magically and unexpectedly, a more classically styled dancer, Aleksei Fadeyechev, was able to achieve stunningly the declamatory force the title role had with its creator, Vladimir Vassiliev. This was great dancing, shaped to the utmost and accompanied by dramatic projection in the acting.</p>
        <p>Each of these programs closes with the first act of ''Spartacus'' and opens with the first act of ''Romeo and Juliet,'' both choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich.</p>
        <p>His opening view of Prokofiev's score succeeds marvelously on its own ground and with its rich Renaissance-red decor by Simon Virsaladze. It was interesting to see, Saturday night, Miss Semenyaka as Juliet to Andris Liepa's Romeo, again elegantly danced and deeply romantic. Exquisite in her skimming steps across the floor, aristocratic in her neo-classical line, Miss Semenyaka danced like a flowing stream. And yet the final balcony duet with Mr. Liepa became a sensuous sigh as her body floated into his embrace.</p>
        <p>Yes, the Bolshoi dancers are sexy and there is no need to look far for the root of their appeal. The very physicality of their dancing contributes to this quality. More than the Kirov, they have conserved the supple-back ''plastique'' that became popular in Soviet ballet in the 1920's.</p>
        <p>One of the prime exponents of this style is the exciting Nina Ananiashvili, who would have been a perfect protegee to Michel Fokine, and whose Black Swan pas de deux with Mr. Fadayechev Saturday evening had both incredible speed and a welcome softness. The program included the ''Corsaire'' pas de deux stolidly danced by Vitali Artyushkin and merely correctly danced by Alla Khaniashvili-Artyushkina. The music from the Arabian dance from Mr. Grigorovich's version of''The Nutcracker'' was used for an ''Indian'' duet for Mariya Zubkova and Aleksandr Valuyev - a hit with the audience and useful as a change of pace.</p>
        <p>Mariya Bilova and Andrei Shakhin brought the frieze-like duet from Mr. Grigorovich's ''Legend of Love'' to life more than their predecessors and the Fokine ''Chopiniana'' waltz duet with Tatyana Golikova and Aleksei Dovgopoliy was decently performed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mukhamedov also partnered Nina Semizorova, a tough little dancer whose performance was on the sloppy side here, in the ''Don Quixote'' pas de deux. As a matter of fact, his dancing in his solo was even more polished here than when he partnered Miss Semenyaka. In the afternoon, he and Miss Semenyaka delighted the public with their Spanish mannerisms, which Mr. Mukhamedov later toned down in his more distanced rapport with Miss Semizorova. Miss Semenyaka, grinning and flouncing, spinning in her smooth pirouettes, got away with near-murder. She is New York's darling.</p>
        <p>At the same matinee, Miss Semizorova showed her impressive lyrical style in Pyotr Gusev's staging of a pas de deux from the 1889 Petipa ballet, ''The Talisman.'' Aleksandr Vetrov was the windgod who danced with Miss Semizorova as Niriti -whose goddess mother had given her a star as talisman. None of this shows up, of course, in what looks like a conventional pas de deux full of deep curtsies for the ballerina.</p>
        <p>Asaf Messerer's athletic ''Spring Waters'' duet, once the epitome of Bolshoi style and now danced by Leonid Nikonov and Inna Petrova, proved to be less than second nature to the current Bolshoi generation. Alla Mikhalchenko's Black Swan, with Mr. Fadeyechev, was a bit on the jerky side at the matinee but in the evening her Aegina in ''Spartacus,'' with a convincing Crassus from Aleksei Lazarev, was clearly etched. A special word for the gallant style of Yuri Posokhov's Paris in ''Romeo and Juliet,'' and the commitment the ensemble gives to the dueling scenes - these young men always come out swinging.</p>
