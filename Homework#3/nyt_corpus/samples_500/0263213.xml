        <p>Greg Maddux held San Francisco to two runs in seven and two-thirds innings today and added two singles and the game-winning run batted in to lead the Chicago Cubs past Rick Reuschel and the Giants, 3-2.</p>
        <p>Maddux (7-7) won for the sixth time in his last eight starts. Reuschel (12-3) lost for the first time since April 28, ending a winning streak at a career-high nine games.</p>
        <p>Maddux allowed seven hits and Mitch Williams pitched the final inning and a third for his 20th save.</p>
        <p>With the score tied at 2-2, Vance Law led off the fourth with a double for Chicago and scored one out later when Maddux singled to center. Maddux is 12 for 38 (.316) with 4 r.b.i. this season.  Dodgers 1, Pirates 0</p>
        <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Jose Gonzalez's grounder bounced off Jose Lind, the Pittsburgh second baseman, for a single to score Eddie Murray with two out in the ninth inning. The Pirates' winning streak ended at six games.</p>
        <p>With one out, Murray singled off John Smiley (7-2) and went to second when Mike Marshall walked. After Jeff Hamilton popped out to second, Gonzalez, who has 14 hits in his last 31 times at bat, extended his hitting streak to 10 games with a single on an 0-2 pitch.</p>
        <p>Marshall, who spent June on the disabled list with a sore back, played in his first game since May 31.  Cardinals 9, Padres 3</p>

        <p>The Astros took a 1-0 lead in the fifth when Craig Reynolds singled against Pascual Perez (4-9) and scored when Trevino grounded a 3-2 pitch down the left-field line. Montreal tied the score with a run in the bottom of the innin.</p>
        <p>With one out in the seventh, Houston had runners on second and third when Montreal intentionally walked Ken Caminiti to get to Trevino, the eighth-place hitter. Trevino lined a double into the left-field corner to score all three runners.  Phillies 4, Braves 2</p>
