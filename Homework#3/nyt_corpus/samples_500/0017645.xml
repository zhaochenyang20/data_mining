        <p>LEAD: The Condit House has a lot going for it. The three-story, Federal-style structure in West Orange, N.J., thought to be built in 1821, has four marble fireplaces, hand-carved woodwork, a fieldstone foundation and wavy window panes. ''But it has been bastardized,'' said Richard Polton, a developer specializing in historic restoration, referring to the white vinyl siding that now sheathes the original scallop-edged clapboards.</p>

        <p>The Condit House has a lot going for it. The three-story, Federal-style structure in West Orange, N.J., thought to be built in 1821, has four marble fireplaces, hand-carved woodwork, a fieldstone foundation and wavy window panes. ''But it has been bastardized,'' said Richard Polton, a developer specializing in historic restoration, referring to the white vinyl siding that now sheathes the original scallop-edged clapboards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Polton, president of Touchstone Properties in Montclair, N.J., has a contract to buy the house, at 7 Main Street, for $350,000 from St. Mark's Episcopal Church next door, which has owned it since 1885. Upon taking title, Mr. Polton plans to restore and convert the 14-room property into 7,000 square feet of professional office space, to be leased for $12 a foot.</p>
        <p>Touchstone Properties, together with Brawer &amp; Hauptman Architects of Philadelphia, will restore the exterior to its original state, peeling off the vinyl and determining historic color schemes. The interior, whose first floor was recently refurbished by a local preservationist, Louise Dixon Schickhaus, will be done as well. The house was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.</p>
