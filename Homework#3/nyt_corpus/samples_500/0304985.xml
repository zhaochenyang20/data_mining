        <p>LEAD: Honeywell Inc. said it had agreed to sell its Electro-Optics division to the Loral Corporation, a New York military electronics company, for undisclosed terms.</p>
        <p>Honeywell Inc. said it had agreed to sell its Electro-Optics division to the Loral Corporation, a New York military electronics company, for undisclosed terms.</p>
        <p>Electro-Optics, based in Lexington, Mass., employs 1,200 people. It specializes in infrared imaging components for the military. A spokesman for Honeywell would not disclose its annual revenues. The division is one of several military units Honeywell has said it will sell because they are outside the company's strategy. Honeywell's stock rose 50 cents a share today, to $78.875, on the New York Stock Exchange, while Loral was unchanged at $30.75.</p>
