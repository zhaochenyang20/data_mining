        <p>The 37th annual Grammy Awards will be a battle between the old and the new. Some 435 nominees for the annual music awards, which will be given out in a ceremony on March 1 in Los Angeles, were announced yesterday by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in a news conference at the Hard Rock Cafe in Manhattan, and they include more young artists in top categories than in recent years.</p>
        <p>In the competition for record of the year, an award given to a single, a new artist, Sheryl Crow ("All I Wanna Do"), is going up against old hands like Bruce Springsteen ("Streets of Philadelphia") and Bonnie Raitt ("Love Sneakin' Up on You"). For album of the year, the young gun Seal ("Seal") challenges Tony Bennett ("MTV Unplugged"), Eric Clapton ("From the Cradle") and the operatic juggernaut of Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jose Carreras ("The Three Tenors in Concert '94"). More dramatically, in the best spoken word or nonmusical album category, the punk-rock poet Henry Rollins must compete with the Bible (as read by Gregory Peck).</p>

        <p>The 37th annual Grammy Awards will be a battle between the old and the new. Some 435 nominees for the annual music awards, which will be given out in a ceremony on March 1 in Los Angeles, were announced yesterday by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in a news conference at the Hard Rock Cafe in Manhattan, and they include more young artists in top categories than in recent years.</p>
        <p>In the competition for record of the year, an award given to a single, a new artist, Sheryl Crow ("All I Wanna Do"), is going up against old hands like Bruce Springsteen ("Streets of Philadelphia") and Bonnie Raitt ("Love Sneakin' Up on You"). For album of the year, the young gun Seal ("Seal") challenges Tony Bennett ("MTV Unplugged"), Eric Clapton ("From the Cradle") and the operatic juggernaut of Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jose Carreras ("The Three Tenors in Concert '94"). More dramatically, in the best spoken word or nonmusical album category, the punk-rock poet Henry Rollins must compete with the Bible (as read by Gregory Peck).</p>
        <p>Sweeping up nominations this year were Elton John, Babyface, Ms. Crow, Ms. Raitt and Mr. Springsteen, who received five nominations each. Among these artists, only Ms. Crow, a singer who released her debut album last year, has never been nominated for a Grammy. All the rest have been nominated at least 12 times and received no less than 2 Grammys each.</p>
        <p>Also prevalent among the list of nominees is the soundtrack to "The Lion King," which received eight nominations.</p>
        <p>Last year, the recording academy was criticized for combining the best male and female rock vocal performance awards and then not nominating any women for the new sex-neutral category. The recording academy claimed that no eligible female entries could be found. This year, the award has been separated into female and male divisions again, and the recording academy has found five eligible female rock singers: Liz Phair, Melissa Etheridge, Sam Phillips, Ms. Raitt and Ms. Crow.</p>
        <p>Another new category, best rock album, will also be particularly interesting to watch because it includes releases by a top group and a well-established performer who have never received competitive Grammys: the Rolling Stones ("Voodoo Lounge") and Neil Young ("Sleeps With Angels"). Other categories added this year include best pop vocal collaboration, best country album and best Latin jazz performance.</p>
        <p>In classical music, the nominees for best album all feature works by 20th-century composers: Samuel Barber, Bela Bartok, Claude Debussy and Gustav Mahler.</p>
        <p>The winners in each category will be announced at the Grammy show, to be held at the Shrine Auditorium, and televised by CBS, with Paul Reiser as the master of ceremonies. They will be selected by 7,000 singers, musicians, record-business professionals and other members of the recording academy. Recordings released between Oct. 1, 1993, and Sept. 30, 1994, were eligible.</p>
