        <p>Her marriage eight days earlier had given her a calm that she had never felt before. And being paired in today's final round of the Chrysler-Plymouth Tournament of Champions with last year's leading money-winner, Karrie Webb, was all the motivation that Annika Sorenstam needed.</p>

        <p>Her marriage eight days earlier had given her a calm that she had never felt before. And being paired in today's final round of the Chrysler-Plymouth Tournament of Champions with last year's leading money-winner, Karrie Webb, was all the motivation that Annika Sorenstam needed.</p>
        <p>''I get really inspired playing with her,'' said Sorenstam, who entered today's round tied with Webb for the lead at 10 under par. ''She doesn't miss a lot of fairways or greens.''</p>
        <p>Webb, however, had trouble solving Weston Hills Country Club's 6,113-yard layout today, but Sorenstam, using a new putter, did not. Sorenstam dropped eight birdies, sandwiched around two bogeys, en route to a 66 that enabled her to finish at 16-under-par 272, four strokes better than Webb.</p>
        <p>Sorenstam turned adversity into triumph. Five of her clubs were damaged last week in an airline baggage accident, including her putter. She switched to a putter with zero loft, which turned out to be ''perfect,'' she said, ''because the greens here are so fast.''</p>
        <p>Barb Mucha finished third, one stroke behind Webb after Webb birdied on the final hole.</p>
        <p>As this shootout between Sorenstam and Webb unfolded today, never mind that Webb often outdrove Sorenstam by some 15 yards. Sorenstam's putter was more than the equalizer, especially on the back nine where, machine-like, she had four birdies.</p>
        <p>Besides the eight birdies, Sorenstam's putts for birdie on Holes 6 and 7 lipped the cup.</p>
        <p>''I never putted this well,'' she said. ''All week I could see the line from when I walked up to the putt.''</p>
        <p>Webb said: ''She was just making them from everywhere. It just wasn't meant to be for me.''</p>
        <p>Sorenstam thought the turning point was the 12th hole. At that point, Webb trailed by only a stroke and had a 4-foot putt for a birdie, while Sorenstam was looking at a 12-foot shot to make birdie.</p>
        <p>''I imagine she felt pretty tired when I made that,'' Sorenstam said. ''I know I would be tired playing someone who makes every single putt.''</p>
        <p>The 26-year-old Swede was just getting warmed up. She made a 15-footer on No. 15, but by Webb's estimation, it was her 20-footer on No. 16 that settled this duel.</p>
        <p>''Going into the hole, I was thinking: 'I'm three down with three to go. I still have a chance,' '' Webb said. ''But when she made that long one, I said, 'That's it.' ''</p>
        <p>Sorenstam said she wasn't even thinking birdie on that hole.</p>
        <p>''I was thinking I just wanted to try to get it close, and it went in,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So it was a wonderfully memorable week for Sorenstam. Her marriage a week ago Saturday to David Esch certainly didn't hurt.</p>
        <p>''I think I'm walking on clouds right now,'' said Sorenstam, who won $115,000 and a new Chrysler Sebring convertible. ''I am so happy on the inside that I guess it helps me play better. I feel so relaxed.''</p>
        <p>Esch followed Sorenstam around the course, providing comfort wherever possible. After each hole, he would try to think of something positive to say. Over dinner Saturday night, Esch said to her: ''It's the first tournament of the year. Take it easy. You're doing great.''</p>
        <p>At the time, maybe even he didn't realize just how right he was.</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JENNY LIDBACK, a 33-year-old from Scottsdale, Ariz., Sunday became the first person in the Ladies Professional Golf Association's 48-year history to sink a hole-in-one on consecutive days. Saturday's ace came on the 147-yard No. 17 and just flew into the cup. Sunday's came on the 146-yard No. 11, hit 15 feet from the hole and bounced in. ''This one was going right at it, but it never crossed my mind it would go in,'' said Lidback, who finished tied for 11th place, 15 shots behind Sorenstam.</p>
