        <p>Top American military officers flew here today in an apparent effort to lay the basis for deploying more American forces -- possibly including ground troops -- in NATO's effort to stop Serbs from driving ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.</p>
        <p>Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the NATO commander, arrived at mid-afternoon and immediately drove from the once decrepit airport, now swarming with helicopters and relief supplies, to meetings with Albanian Government officials.</p>
        <p>His trip was so suddenly arranged that United States Air Force press officers at the airport had no inkling of it until queried by journalists in the late morning.</p>
        <p>After his talks, General Clark said American Apache helicopters ''will be arriving here very shortly,'' but declined to give a date. ''It's a matter of finishing our coordination and preparation here to receive them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>General Clark also condemned what he called plans by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia ''to threaten, harass and intimidate neighboring states,'' including Albania, whose northern territory has been subjected to sporadic Serbian shelling.</p>
        <p>General Clark's second in command, Lieut. Gen. Dan Coffee, the deputy commander in Europe, was here on Friday to assess the resources available in this impoverished country, which has taken in more than 300,000 Kosovo refugees.</p>
        <p>While military officials were tight-lipped, it is possible that the visits could presage some change in NATO tactics of relying on bombing alone. Air strikes have damaged the Yugoslav infrastructure but apparently not interfered with the Serbs' drive to purge Kosovo of ethnic Albanians.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a wave of about 13,000 new refugees crossed the Albanian border at Kukes during the night, relief workers said. Many of the new refugees, relief workers say, are people who have been hiding in the woods and mountains for weeks. They are suffering from exposure, hunger and dehydration.</p>
        <p>In advance of a key vote in Congress on a special appropriation measure for the Kosovo campaign, a Congressional delegation flew in to visit the refugee camps.</p>
        <p>Standing slightly apart from the delegation, Maj. Gen. Randy West of the Marines quietly eyed the scene, taking a longer view.</p>
        <p>''I'm here to gather my own intel,'' General West said, referring to intelligence information he might need if marines were sent here in large numbers. General West is the commander of the Second Marine Expeditionary Force based at Camp Lejeune, N.C.</p>
        <p>One Marine expeditionary unit from the Sixth Fleet is already in the area, and another is on the way, General West said. But, he added, he wanted to be ready for the possibility that larger numbers of marines might be called on.</p>
        <p>A Marine expeditionary unit is a roughly regimental sized strike force, based on a ship, with its own attached helicopters, Harrier jump jets and other close-in support aircraft and some small amphibious armored vehicles. It numbers roughly 2,000 to 2,400 troops and is commanded by a colonel.</p>
        <p>During the Kurdish refugee crisis in southern Turkey after the Persian Gulf war of 1991, marines, who can be quickly deployed from their ships, were used to provide relief and to protect Kurdish refugees seeking to return to Iraq.</p>
        <p>Marines could also be used to provide perimeter security for the long-awaited Apache helicopters.</p>
        <p>But the major strength of the marines is as a quick mobile strike force, capable of attacking enemy positions in helicopter assault or opening a beachhead for more heavily equipped conventional forces.</p>
        <p>Both of the Marine Expeditionary Units that do six-month rotations with the Sixth Fleet are trained in unconventional, small-unit tactics like fighting terrorists or rescuing hostages.</p>
