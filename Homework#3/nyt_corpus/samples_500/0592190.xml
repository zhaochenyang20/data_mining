        <p>The Nassau County Comptroller's office closed the books today on the 1992 budget, revealing what everyone had expected: a $119.9 million deficit in the county's general fund.</p>
        <p>Alan Gurien, the acting comptroller, said the deficit -- about $1 million less than earlier projections -- was the largest in county history. The 1992 general fund budget was about $1.1 billion.</p>
        <p>There are already some problems in this year's budget, involving an unknown number of county positions that lack financing, Mr. Gurien said.</p>
        <p>While this year's budget comes with claims that it will eliminate the deficit, the figures released today suggest that some items that contributed to last year's deficit remain -- though in a more manageable form.</p>
        <p>The 1993 budget proposes largely to eliminate the county's deficit through $65 million in long-term borrowing, about $31 million in a transfer from the police fund and by keeping the county's payroll down from what it was two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gurien, echoing the views of many county officials, said today that the problems of 1993 should be minimal compared with those of 1992, which he likened to a "forest fire that burns down everything so that we can start growing again." Last year, the county laid off thousands of workers.</p>
        <p>According to figures released by Mr. Gurien today, the 1992 deficit was largely a result of, among other things, $38.3 million in lost revenue from failing to sell a parcel of county land; $33.5 million in unanticipated payroll expenditures; $15.5 million in sales tax shortfalls; $14.9 million in state aid shortfalls, and $27.7 million in unexpected subsidies to the Nassau County Medical Center, the A. Holly Patterson Geriatric Center and the county road fund. This was partly offset by unexpected savings of $14.2 million in the Department of Social Services, Mr. Gurien said.</p>
        <p>Some of these variances are unlikely to arise again in this year's budget. For instance, county officials have lowered their projections for sales tax revenues and state aid in 1993.</p>
