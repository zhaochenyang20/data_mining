        <p>Two years after the "velvet revolution" that he led, President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia is struggling to preserve the unity of his country against Slovak separatist strivings.</p>
        <p>The possibility of a breakup of Czechoslovakia, founded in 1918 after the demise of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, seemed unthinkable when Mr. Havel came to power late in December 1989. Now, though, the unthinkable occupies the top of the President's agenda, and he is considering the worst.</p>
        <p>"I have said many times that I am a supporter of a common state," Mr. Havel said in an interview last week. "But if life together in one state is not possible, I favor a constitutional separation."</p>
        <p>The Czechoslovak leader rejected a comparison with the warring republics of Yugoslavia, where separatism has led to warfare. "I think it is very improbable that our dispute could lead to violent conflict," Mr. Havel said. "It is not in our tradition. We have never been at war against each other."  An Office in Slovakia</p>
        <p>Significantly, the interview did not take place in Prague, the national and Czech capital, but here in the Slovak capital. Hoping to take the sting out of complaints that, as a Czech, he does not give full recognition to Slovak equality, Mr. Havel has established a presidential office in Bratislava Castle and last week conducted the nation's affairs from there.</p>
        <p>The Czechoslovak leader has been the target of Slovak separatists more than once since he took office. The most recent incident occurred during his last visit here on Oct. 28, the Czechoslovak national day, when Mr. Havel was prevented from speaking in the main square by an egg-throwing, jeering crowd of Slovak separatists.</p>
        <p>Many in the crowd were identified as regular participants in unruly street demonstrations, including a daylong siege of Parliament organized by the Slovak National Party, a separatist group that received 14 percent of the vote in parliamentary elections in June 1990.</p>
        <p>The President advocated a new constitutional arrangement that would give the Czech and Slovak republics full equality in the federal state. He said Czechoslovakia's international prestige, regained since the ouster of the Communist leadership in December 1989, depended on it.</p>
        <p>However, a two-day meeting by the legislative leaders of both republics, which had been expected to adopt a basis for new constitutional structures aimed at political equality, ended in failure last Tuesday. This, together with a subsequent effort to push a sovereignty resolution through the Slovak Parliament, so far inconclusive, has made the President grim and his senior advisers gloomy.</p>
        <p>"This is the beginning of the end," a Slovak aide to Mr. Havel said. After that failure, the national Parliament declined to heed the President's urging to call a national referendum on the question. The President and his advisers believe that a majority of Czechs and Slovaks continue to favor a single country and want a referendum to go over the heads of the Slovak political establishment.  Havel Wants Referendum</p>
        <p>In a television address on Sunday night, Mr. Havel proposed a package of constitutional measures that would give him the right to order a referendum without Parliament's approval and to call a referendum when 20 percent of the voters in either republic petition for it.</p>
        <p>He urged citizens to demand that their legislators approve the measures, which he said represented "the only way of overcoming the threat of a deep constitutional crisis."</p>
        <p>Slovak supporters of a single Czechoslovakia are speaking in earnest of "emigration" to the Czech republic, and owners of new and private small businesses said they had transferred their accounts to Czech banks.</p>
        <p>Those who oppose a separate Slovak state said in many interviews during two trips through this republic of 5 million that they believed that only through a continued union with Prague would their newly restored democracy be assured of surviving.</p>
        <p>The only supposedly independent Slovak state in history was created by Hitler when he dismantled Czechoslovakia following the Munich agreement. It became a satellite of Nazi Germany, participating in the war against the Allies until it was reincorporarted into Czechoslovakia in 1945.  In Shadow of Czechs</p>
        <p>Mr. Havel said he was sympathetic to the strong need of Slovaks for "a sense of self-fulfillment." He added, "During the entire existence of this republic, the Slovak nation has lived in the shadow of the Czech nation."</p>
        <p>The President's supporters in Slovakia cite historic factors that have contributed to the tension between the Czechs and Slovaks.</p>
        <p>The Czech lands, which consist of Bohemia, Moravia and a part of Silesia and have 10 million people, have a long past as national entities. They shared in the intellectual life of the Renaissance and Enlightenment. They were ruled from Vienna, whose hand, though far from liberal, was lighter than that of Hungary, which did not regard the lands now called Slovakia as anything but an integral part of that country.</p>
        <p>The Czech lands constituted the industrial heartland of the empire; Slovakia was left largely agricultural.</p>
        <p>Until 1918, there were no schools that taught in Slovak, a language close to Czech. Most education was in Hungarian, with some in German. "There were many Czech teachers who came here after 1918 to teach us Slovak," said Mariana Hrabinska, a reporter in Banska Bystrica, a central Slovak town.</p>
        <p>Advocates of the federated system agree that national governments in Prague since 1918 have failed to take actions necessary to equalize the two regions and give Slovaks a sense of equal standing. But they do not believe that breaking up the country will improve the lives of Slovaks.</p>
        <p>They note a drastic reduction since the 1990 voting of open support for the federal state. Public Against Violence, the pro-Havel civic movement that won a 30-percent plurality, was split by a former Slovak Premier, Vladimir Meciar. The party he formed is now the largest and its policies are increasingly separatist, and Mr. Meciar is now the most popular political figure after Mr. Havel in opinion polls.</p>
        <p>Jan Carnogursky, the present Slovak Premier, is also a former Havel supporter. He is now the leader of the Christian Democrats, the second-largest party, and gives only qualified support to a federal state. In an interview, he said Czechoslovakia should cease to exist when it is admitted into the European Community. It should enter as two states, he said, as the common country will have lost its reason for being.</p>
        <p>Havel supporters take what optimism they can from the fact that Slovak separatism is greatest here in Bratislava and in central Slovakia, while the large region of the east, around Kosice, Slovakia's second city, has traditionally looked to Prague rather than Bratislava.</p>
        <p>But in Kosice, pro-Havel leaders, while confirming that there was little support for the separatists, spoke gloomily of political passivity and growing resentment of Prague because of a rapid rise in unemployment. Heavy industries, created by the Communists largely to produce exportable goods to the Soviet Union, face a catastrophic shrinkage of markets.</p>
        <p>A visit to the area by Mr. Havel Thursday and Friday cheered the President -- he encountered no jeers -- but it also gave credence to the local leaders' views of voter passivity and the President's decline in poularity.  Mr. Havel was met by warm but small crowds, and most of the 260,000 people of Kosice showed little interest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Havel believes that only "a quick and civilized" solution of the Slovak problem can bring economic recovery.</p>
        <p>"If we don't so this" Mr. Havel said, "we can hardly expect any foreign assistance. Everybody is waiting for this, everybody is hesitating because of our unstable domestic situation. This is the first requirement for everything.</p>
        <p>"The most important task is to maintain such respect as we have gained in the world by resolving our domestic problem," he said. "If we fail, we lose this respect."</p>
