        <p>LEAD: A TOURISM official for one Caribbean country said candidly that it had so far been a ''soft'' season, and she did not mean the weather. But her unhappiness at the slowness of business translates into good news for people who find themselves sick of winter at the end of February but still with no reservations for a sunshine fix.</p>
        <p>A TOURISM official for one Caribbean country said candidly that it had so far been a ''soft'' season, and she did not mean the weather. But her unhappiness at the slowness of business translates into good news for people who find themselves sick of winter at the end of February but still with no reservations for a sunshine fix.</p>
        <p>A trip to a warm island is still possible to put together from now to April 15, the end of the Caribbean high season. There are rooms available in hotels and smaller lodgings, and there are airplane seats, too. Some officials said that the stock market plunge in October caused cancellations in high-priced hotels - although some of these rooms were later reported rebooked - but a number of places report some vacancies across the board.</p>
        <p>The hoteliers may not be prepared to give a flat-out discount, but most have vacancies and will welcome the business, perhaps even agreeing to upgrade accommodations. For example, one couple we met in Tobago had arrived to use a time-sharing condominium but found it too noisy and asked for and got a cabana on the beach at no added cost.</p>
        <p>The availability of rooms and airplane seats at this time of year also arises from the late onset of cold weather, according to Joe N. Garzilli, president of Flyfaire, a wholesale tour packager. ''The winter just started out slow for the Caribbean travel business,'' he said in an interview. ''The stock market events in October, or more precisely, the media perceptions of the stock market events, held things down. Then the 2-degree weather was a little late in arriving. But when it did arrive, we got busy, stock market or no.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Garzilli suggested that those desperate for the sun consider the Bahamas as well as the Caribbean. ''Normally, you could not expect to get space in the Bahamas from late February into March,'' he said. ''That is when the Bahamas weather is at its best. But the slowness of the start in Caribbean sales meant that the overflow that usually fills up the Bahamas did not come along as expected. Prices are a little less, for both air and land, in the Bahamas, too.''</p>
        <p>Almost all those who gave advice on last-minute plans for the islands said that there was space in their area - perhaps not in that perfect place, they said, but space. The occupancy rate was often reported at 80 to 90 percent. Barbados used the figure of 90 percent full, but as Peter Rothholz, a spokesman, pointed out, the island has 12,000 beds for tourists, and at 90 percent full this would leave 1,200 beds available. On a smaller island, 10 percent availability might not allow much choice.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the French West Indies, Myron Clement, said in mid-February that he had just returned and that the season, while good, had not been up to hopes in his area, so there was space for a spur-of-the-moment visitor. He stayed on an island just off Guadeloupe, Les Saintes (Iles des Saintes), which he described as a relaxed, out-of-the-way place, much like St. Barthelemy a dozen years ago. The island is reached by a short boat or plane trip from Guadeloupe.</p>
        <p>The French West Indies Tourist Board, through the French Government Tourist Office, will provide United States phone numbers for agents representing hotels in its area. The address is 610 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 11020; 212-757-1125 (there is no 800 number for this organization). Two West Indian hotel chains may be reached directly: Mondotels at 212-757-0225 or 800-847-4249, and Pullman International Hotels at 212-757-6500 or 800-223-9862.</p>
        <p>The St. Kitts and Nevis tourist association reported an ample number of rooms available at a range of prices. A particularly good buy appeared to be the Frigate Bay Beach Hotel in St. Kitts, a short walk to a beach, which said it had doubles available at $95 a night. The Fairview Inn at Basseterre on St. Kitts had doubles at $70 a night but it is not on the beach. The Rest Haven, a small beachfront hotel near Charlestown on Nevis, had double rooms at $60 a night. Pinney's Beach Hotel, in Charlestown, had doubles at $130 with breakfast and dinner. Up the scale some, Cliffdwellers Cottages near Charlestown had doubles, with breakfast and dinner, at $210. The St. Kitts and Nevis tourist association is at 414 East 75th Street, New York, N.Y. 10021, 212-535-1234.</p>
        <p>In discussing rooms in the higher-price brackets, several Caribbean experts mentioned new or revamped hotels as possibilities, on the premise that they had not built up a return clientele to tide them through a slow year. For Anguilla, Joan Medhurst, a spokeswoman, pointed to Coccoloba Plantation, which has just opened with 51 rooms and suites on a two-mile beach. E. David Brewer, general manager of Coccoloba, said that he had been running at 75 percent occupancy with bigger rooms at $350 a night and $290 for smaller rooms, both with breakfast. Inquiries through 212-840-6636 or 800-351-5656.</p>
        <p>In Barbados, which appears to have had a busy season, the Royal Pavilion, north of Holetown in St. James's Parish on the leeward coast, was mentioned as a new luxury hotel. It opened on Dec. 15 with 75 oceanfront ''junior suites'' and a three-bedroom villas. The suites - a bedroom, bath and balcony - go for $275 a night, and there was some space in March. Reservations: 809-422-4444 or 809-422-5555.</p>
        <p>SOME officials were coy about it and some were blunt, but all said that many hotels that had in earlier years sold only for a Saturday-to-Saturday week at a time are now willing to let rooms for four days and three nights. Mr. Garzilli said that a traveler flexible enough to accept a Tuesday or Wednesday arrival and departure might also find doors opening. ''Many places are trying to space out their arrival days,'' he said, and judging by my own recent Caribbean trip, the Saturday move-out and clean-up crush stretches a hotel's staff.</p>
        <p>Trinidad and Tobago's tourist board in New York reports space available across the board for March. The Kapok Hotel, a modest but clean 71-room place just off the main park in very urban Port of Spain, Trinidad, has double rooms available at $68 a night. On the weekend, many people from Trinidad take a brief plane trip to Tobago, where almost everything is beach-oriented. The Crown Reef, which you can walk to from the airport, has double rooms facing the ocean available in March at $120 a night. The hotel is on a steep rock, but it adjoins Store Bay and is also a pleasant half-hour walk to Pigeon Point, a long, glorious beach. Information on these two hotels and others in the same country: Executive Resorts, 800-551-4000 or 305-595-0100.</p>
        <p>Tourism officials representing St. Thomas and St. John, United States Virgin Islands, reported a slower season than last year's, which was a ''banner year,'' but said that bookings jumped when ''Good Morning America'' broadcast from there in the first week in February. Since then, Tom Bennett of the St. Thomas-St. John Hotel Association said, bookings have been running at 80 percent and the available rooms are in all price categories. The islands maintain offices in New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington. The number in New York is 212-582-4520.</p>
        <p>Getting a flight will prove easier if you don't tie yourself down to a Saturday departure and a Sunday return. Also, if you cannot find a direct flight, you should investigate what is available out of Miami, assuming you can get to Miami. The farther south in the Caribbean you go, you will improve your chances of good weather.</p>
        <p>A travel agent can work out a plan for you, or you can start by calling some airlines to find a flight to an area that interests you. Many airlines sell packages including flights and hotels at prices that are a saving over buying air and land accommodations separately. You could also call directory assistance for the Caribbean, 809-555-1212, and ask for the tourist board or hotel association for the country that you want.</p>
