        <p>Indonesia's top military commander, disputing reports of thousands of deaths in East Timor, said today that fewer than 100 people had been killed in the violence in the province.</p>
        <p>''The number of victims that we have recorded since the announcement of the result of the referendum is roughly in the 90's,'' said the commander, Gen. Wiranto. ''That is the number we have recorded so far, but it is not the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands as reported by the foreign media,'' he told the Indonesian Parliament.</p>

        <p>Indonesia's top military commander, disputing reports of thousands of deaths in East Timor, said today that fewer than 100 people had been killed in the violence in the province.</p>
        <p>''The number of victims that we have recorded since the announcement of the result of the referendum is roughly in the 90's,'' said the commander, Gen. Wiranto. ''That is the number we have recorded so far, but it is not the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands as reported by the foreign media,'' he told the Indonesian Parliament.</p>
        <p>General Wiranto's estimate is much less than those of pro-independence groups, which put the death toll at anywhere from 900 to 7,000. And it drew a skeptical response from the United Nations, which sheltered hundreds of refugees in the capital, Dili, before abandoning its compound.</p>
