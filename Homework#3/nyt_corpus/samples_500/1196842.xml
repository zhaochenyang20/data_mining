        <p>The United States Soccer Foundation announced yesterday that it was giving more than $2.3 million to 46 groups around the country. The foundation was established in 1993 in advance of expected profits when the United States played host to the men's World Cup in 1994.</p>
        <p>This round of grants includes the awarding of $91,400 to two New York City organizations for the construction and improvement of soccer fields. The Manhattan Kickers Soccer Club's grant will cover the renovation of the East 6th Street field in Manhattan and the installation of FieldTurf, an artificial playing surface that is similar to AstroTurf.</p>
