        <p>LEAD: The United Nations Secretary General has agreed in principle to visit Albania, the last bastion of Stalinism in Europe and a nation accused of serious human rights abuses, diplomats and United Nations officials said today.</p>
        <p>The United Nations Secretary General has agreed in principle to visit Albania, the last bastion of Stalinism in Europe and a nation accused of serious human rights abuses, diplomats and United Nations officials said today.</p>
        <p>The Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, was invited by Foreign Minister Reis Malile of Albania when he visited the General Assembly in October. It was the first time Albania had invited the top United Nations official to make an official visit. The invitation will make Mr. Perez de Cuellar one of the most senior foreign visitors that Albania has received in recent years.</p>
        <p>Albania's United Nations Representative, Bashkim Petarka, confirmed the invitation and the Secretary General's acceptance, saying the invitation represents the ''high esteem'' in which the Albanian Government holds Mr. Perez de Cuellar and its desire ''to cooperate very closely with all the work of the United Nations.''</p>
        <p>While a precise date has not been fixed, the most likely time for the visit would be in May, when the Secretary General is expected to travel to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, United Nations officials said.</p>
        <p>Democratization Rejected</p>
        <p>Albanian issued its invitation to the Secretary General before it publicly rejected the democratic changes sweeping the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe earlier this month and said it would remain faithful to its own brand of repressive Marxism.</p>
        <p>The invitation also came before recent reports that the authorities have brutally suppressed riots and demonstrations inspired by the political changes in Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>In a New Year's address, the Albanian leader, Ramiz Alia, said the popular uprisings that have ended Communist Party control over much of Eastern Europe would not affect his country because the Government's strict Marxist line hads served it well. ''Therefore, just like yesterday and today, in the future, too, we shall pursue it loyally,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When Albania celebrated its National Day on Jan. 11, the Communist Party's daily paper, Zeri i Popullit, accused Albanian exiles of fermenting discontent in the country and said they were trying to restore the monarchy.</p>
        <p>The paper dismissed what it called ''the prescriptions of the capitalist road, of perestroika and bourgeois reformism,'' calling them ''unacceptable to our people and party.''</p>
        <p>Disturbances Reported</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Yugoslavian newspapers reported that a state of emergency had been declared in the northern town of Scutari after popular demonstrations there and that security was being stepped up around the homes of Albanian leaders in Tirana, the capital.</p>
        <p>An Albanian border guard who escaped to Greece last week reported that the army and the police had fired on the demonstrators in Scutari and that disturbances had also occurred at Koritsa and Sarande.</p>
        <p>Albania is under investigation by the United Nations Human Rights Commission. Human rights lawyers say further changes may be brought against the Government this year as a result of the recent disturbances.</p>
        <p>Western diplomats believe Albania's decision to invite the Secretary General marks a further extension of the very gradual opening toward the outside world that has been under way in Europe's most isolated country since the death of its hard-line leader, Enver Hoxha, in 1985.</p>
        <p>Some New Commercial Links</p>
        <p>After having virtually no contact with the rest of the world for years, Albania has begun to develop limited commercial links with Austria, Italy, West Germany and Britain.</p>
        <p>Last January it played host to a meeting of deputy foreign ministers of Balkan nations. Later this year the foreign ministers of these same Balkan nations - Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Rumania - will meet in Tirana.</p>
        <p>When he addressed the General Assembly last October, Foreign Minister Malile stressed the country's commitment to what he called ''the process of Balkan cooperation,'' saying Albania now wants closer ties with its neighbors. But he devoted much of his speech to attacking Yugoslavia for persecuting ethnic Albanians.</p>
        <p>Albania has also invited the heads of several specialized United Nations agencies to visit the country in recent years, including Dr. Nafis Sadik, who directs the United Nations family planning agency, and Edouard Saouma, Director General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.</p>
