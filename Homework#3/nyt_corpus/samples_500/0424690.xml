        <p>THERE is adventure for older people, and Ruth Humleker has found it.</p>
        <p>A year ago, Mrs. Humleker, who is 68 years old, joined the Peace Corps and traveled to Yemen. Her assignment was cut short last summer after only three months because of the Persian Gulf crisis. But she will soon leave for Paraguay and a new assignment, which she hopes will last two years.</p>
        <p>"I just could not play bridge for the next 20 years, and I know many other older people want to do constructive work," Mrs. Humleker said, explaining why she joined the Peace Corps. "My husband died two years ago, and I figured there was still time for adventure."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Humleker said the Peace Corps wanted to enlist older people, even those in their 80's, as well as young people. "One out of six applicants is accepted," she said.</p>
        <p>As a result of her first assignment, she found "older persons highly revered in Yemen."</p>
        <p>The Peace Corps concurs, saying "host governments want more older volunteers."</p>
        <p>Before joining the Peace Corps, Mrs. Humleker worked for a number of years as an arts administrator and author. "I was an associate director of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts," she explained. She visited Leningrad in 1979 and arranged to bring an exhibit from the Hermitage museum to the United States. Then the Soviet Union invaded Afganistan, and the project was canceled.</p>
        <p>Last August, Mrs. Humleker experienced another disappointment. The United States Ambassador to Yemen, Charles F. Dunbar, ordered the 70 Peace Corps workers there to return to the United States because of the gulf crisis.</p>
        <p>"We were about to complete training, which included learning Arabic," Mrs. Humleker said. "I was assigned to teach English, but I never got the chance."</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mrs. Humleker has some pleasant memories of Yemen. "We ate at the training center where food was very good, prepared by Yemeni cooks," Mrs. Humleker said.</p>
        <p>She also recalled a visit one day by a young Yemeni woman on the staff. The woman had asked if she could bring her lunch to Mrs. Humleker's room. Once there, she pulled off her chador -- a large square cloth traditionally worn as a face covering by Moslem women -- and her black robe, revealing lipstick, blue jeans and a T-shirt. Mrs. Humleker said the young woman began to cry complaining that she could never get away from the chador or study abroad because of the war in the Persian Gulf.</p>
        <p>After returning home, Mrs. Humleker asked for another assignment, but she had to wait about six months because 300 Peace Corps workers had been evacuated from Liberia and the Philippines and most of them had also applied for reassignment.</p>
        <p>"You can indicate where you want to go and where you will not serve," she said. Hoping for faster acceptance, she left these lines blank.</p>
        <p>In May, she departs with a group headed for Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, where she will undergo three months of training. Having studied Spanish in college, she said she was sure her fluency in the language would return. "We also have to learn an Indian language called Guarani," she said.</p>
        <p>This time she will be a business adviser. "There has been a large cooperative movement in Paraguay, and I will be assigned to help," she said. "After all, I was an arts administrator. We probably will be stationed outside of the capital."</p>
        <p>Pay in the Peace Corps is minimal, differing from country to country. She received about $30 a month during her training in Yemen, plus food, lodging and her air fare. After the training period, she will receive a small stipend, which she described "as subsistence level," to cover all her living expenses. Later, there is a readjustment based on months served.</p>
        <p>Though the pay is low, Mrs. Humleker said she managed to put her Social Security checks and other income in the bank each month while she was in Yemen. She plans to do the same in Paraguay.</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Humleker leaves for Paraquay, she will be traveling light.</p>
        <p>"We can take only 80 pounds of luggage," she said. A dictionary, a thesaurus, a small paperback encyclopedia, and a couple of plays by Shakespeare are among the books she will be taking with her.</p>
        <p>"This time, I am also taking a portable typewriter," she said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, not content to rest, she has been updating a book she wrote, "New York for the Independent Traveler," published by Marlor Press of Minneapolis. After her stint in South America, she hopes to do a book tentatively called "The Old Lady Goes to Yemen and Paraguay."</p>
