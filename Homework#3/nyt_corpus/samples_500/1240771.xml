        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Plus ca change department: in a letter in the Arts and Leisure section [''A Comedy?,'' Oct. 15], Peter Farley complained that a recent performance of Shakespeare's ''Richard II''  ''was regularly interrupted by bursts of laughter, guffaws, squeaks and knowing humorous rumbles and moans'' produced by an audience that would have preferred to be at an evening of ''Cats.'' Four decades ago, the Arts and Leisure section printed a letter of mine that made the identical complaint -- except instead of ''Richard II'' the play was ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' and instead of ''Cats,''  ''No Time for Sergeants.'' There is nothing new under the sun -- or, apparently, under the moon, at night in the New York theater.</p>
