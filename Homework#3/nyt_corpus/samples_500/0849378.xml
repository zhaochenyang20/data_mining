        <p>YOU could almost hear a collective gasp emanating from the portraits of venerable lawyers lining the walls of the City Bar Association meeting hall the  other night when a speaker first uttered the term. "Superpredators!"</p>
        <p>It has shock value all right. And it solves a little puzzle. For those New Yorkers wondering why their Governor wants to get tougher on juvenile crime -- even though the headlines blare news of a persistently dropping crime rate -- here is one answer. It is fear of the future and of superpredators -- a term in  vogue among some criminologists who are predicting a sharp increase in violent crime in the next few years as the number of teen-agers soars.</p>
        <p>A "ticking time bomb," a report by law enforcement experts called the coming population jump -- a 23 percent increase in 14- to 17-year-old males by 2005 --  a serious problem because the rate of violent crime among teen-agers has soared, even as crime among adults has gone down.</p>
        <p>So New York is getting ready. Gov. George E. Pataki has made recommendations  for getting tougher with young criminals, as well as with adults, and while it seemed for a while that the proposals could slip through without public debate,  they surely are getting attention now as experts discuss them in tones close to  apocalyptic.</p>
        <p>"It's time -- we must prepare for the onslaught of juvenile violence," Peter  Reinharz, a lawyer for the city, said during a panel discussion on a recent night at the City Bar Association in midtown, citing the growing use of the term superpredators.</p>
        <p>THAT upset Michael A. Corriero, an acting State Supreme Court justice presiding over Manhattan's youth part. "We are not dealing with superpredators," he said. "We are dealing with children, 14 and 15-year-old children. We cannot demonize and dehumanize children."</p>
        <p>Not so, said Paul Shechtman, Mr. Pataki's criminal justice director. The Governor's recommendations, making the rounds in Albany, include increasing many minimum sentences for juvenile offenders; transferring all 16-year-olds in detention centers run by the State Division for Youth to the regular prison system, and sharply increasing sentences for once-convicted youths who commit a  serious felony.</p>
        <p>Supporters say the proposals would make the streets safer by putting violent  youths behind bars. Opponents say imprisoning them with hardened criminals would make them more violent. "You can't keep them in forever," said Philip B. Uninsky, senior attorney for Statewide Youth Advocacy. "We know that the longer  the time served, the more dangerous kids become."</p>
        <p>MR. REINHARZ, chief of the Family Court Division of the city's Law Department, said New York had little choice. "Let's put it this way," he said after the panel discussion, explaining that he was speaking for himself, not as a city official. "There is another wave of juvenile crime coming. There are going to be a lot more people after the turn of the century in the teen-age range. There are predictions out there and the question is whether we are prepared if that happens. If it does not, what have we lost?"</p>
        <p>A lot, Justice Corriero and other critics argue. "Don't get me wrong," he said. "I put 15-year-olds away for life. But they're saying we're expecting this incredible bubble of juvenile violence, so let's build more jails, let's increase sentences." If the assumption is correct, he continued, "the answer is  not to increase sentences. The answer is to stop crime before it happens."</p>
        <p>But how? Prevention programs have had deep budget cuts, and there is disagreement on their effectiveness. The same for rehabilitation; up to 86 percent of those who served sentences in Youth Division detention centers are rearrested. And there is no proof that alternative programs for youths are more  successful than incarceration.</p>
        <p>The grim picture argues for more fundamental change than the Governor has proposed -- revamping the juvenile-justice laws to address fundamental flaws. In 1978, in another tough-on-crime era, the Legislature mandated that all 13- 14- and 15-year-olds accused of serious crimes have their cases handled in adult courts; the system treats young offenders accused of serious crimes the same now, making it impossible for judges to exercise discretion and separate the more violent from those who might be redeemable.</p>
        <p>Youth workers say that despite the depressing statistics, young criminals can sometimes be turned around. But if some of today's 5-year-olds are already being labeled tomorrow's "superpredators," how likely is it that policy will be any more benign than the rhetoric?</p>
