        <p>LEAD: After a two-year break forced on him by a painful course of treatment for leukemia, Jose Carreras, the Spanish tenor, chose a little-known provincial arts festival as the occasion to test his strength - and voice - in a full-scale opera.</p>
        <p>After a two-year break forced on him by a painful course of treatment for leukemia, Jose Carreras, the Spanish tenor, chose a little-known provincial arts festival as the occasion to test his strength - and voice - in a full-scale opera.</p>
        <p>He purposely picked a role -Jason, in Cherubini's ''Medea'' -that he had not sung before, to avoid comparisons with any of his own past performances. And with the stage dominated by the flamboyant figure of Montserrat Caballe as Medea, his was also not an exhausting role.</p>
        <p>As a strategy, it worked. The Spanish critics said he passed the test without a hitch, the rich tone of his voice seemingly unaffected either by his illness or by the intense heat that still enveloped Merida's open air Roman Theater when the second of the opera's three performances began shortly before midnight on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Diagnosed with leukemia in July 1987, the 42-year-old tenor has been preparing for his return to opera for the last year with a gentle program of recitals in Europe and the United States. Now, while determined not to overload himself with commitments, he plans to take on the role of Don Jose in Bizet's ''Carmen'' in Vienna next year. Some Other Attractions</p>
        <p>Yet it was more than curiosity, sympathy or admiration for Mr. Carreras that prompted several Government Cabinet members, opera fans from Madrid and beyond and a huge crowd of enthusiastic local residents to attend Spain's first performances of ''Medea.''</p>
        <p>Thanks in part to Mr. Carreras, but also to Miss Caballe, the tenor Placido Domingo and an array of other top Spanish singers, opera is having an extraordinary boom in Spain, playing a central role in the broad cultural revival that has followed the return of democracy here a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Under Franco, the Government did not support the arts, Miss Caballe said. ''Now theaters are being renovated, sponsors are available and, certainly in the case of opera, there is new interest.''</p>
        <p>Today, world-class singers are drawn not only to the Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid and the Teatro del Liceo in Barcelona, but also to regional festivals. Next month, Mr. Carreras, Teresa Berganza, the Spanish mezzo-soprano, and the American bass Samuel Ramey will be singing in recital in Santander, while Luciano Pavarotti will perform in Puccini's ''Boheme'' in Bilbao. The Effect of Publicity</p>
        <p>For Enrique Franco, the music critic of El Pais, an independent daily, the opera boom here has much to do with what he calls ''the bombardment of publicity and marketing'' that surrounds such stars as Mr. Domingo and Mr. Carreras.</p>
        <p>''I'm a bit suspicious because the public responds mainly to the big names and the popular operas,'' he said. ''Without famous singers or famous pieces, there is less interest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Domingo, though, does not apologize for this. ''It's largely our doing,'' he said in a recent interview with El Pais. ''It's been premeditated, at least in my case. We have created a desire to go to the opera because we have become popular by recording popular songs and through publicity.''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Franco said he also saw a positive side to the opera fashion. ''Young Spanish composers are once again writing operas,'' he said, mentioning Cristobal Halffter, Luis de Palo, Jose Ramon Encinar and Leonardo Balada. ''In a few years, we may well find we have 20 new operas.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Encinar's ''Figaro,'' for example, was performed last month in the Teatro de la Zarzuela, while Miss Caballe will sing the main soprano role in the premiere of Mr. Balada's ''Cristobal Colon'' - ''Christopher Columbus'' - in Barcelona in September. A Perfect Setting</p>
        <p>Jose Monleon, director of Merida's Classical Theater Festival, which for the first time has included an opera, pointed out that Spanish theater directors were also now showing interest in opera, among them Lluis Pasqual and Jose Luis Alonso, who directed ''Medea.'' ''This is a theatrical phenomenon, too,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The Roman Theater here was a perfect setting for this opera, not only because its acoustics proved to be good but also because its reconstructed columns and steps were an ideal backdrop for the classical theme of ''Medea.'' A cloudless night and even occasional shooting stars only added to the magic. A Slump in Zarzuela</p>
        <p>Spain's new attraction to opera has led to a slump for the country's traditional light opera, known as the zarzuela. ''Its time has passed,'' Mr. Franco said. ''Even the Teatro de la Zarzuela rarely puts on zarzuelas. But it doesn't mean that it can't make a comeback.''</p>
        <p>Such is the aura of stardom surrounding Mr. Domingo, Mr. Carreras and the like, that even such established though older pillars of Spanish music as the soprano Victoria de los Angeles and the tenor Alfredo Kraus, both of whom mainly sing recitals today, have been somewhat forgotten.</p>
        <p>Rather, the search is on for new superstars. And while none have yet appeared, Miss Berganza and the soprano Pilar Lorenger already have a considerable following, while the young soprano Maria Gallego was hailed for her role as Glauce in ''Medea.''</p>
        <p>While there is undoubted pride in the prominence of Spanish singers, however, the thirst for opera echoes beyond simple nationalism. This week, for example, the Russian contralto, Elena Obraztsova, was acclaimed for her performance as Neris in ''Medea.''</p>
        <p>But if the renovation of the exquisite Teatro Real de la Opera is completed on schedule for the 1991-1992 season, it requires no special powers of prediction to guess that Madrid will also try to challenge Milan - and La Scala - for the title of opera capital of Europe.</p>
