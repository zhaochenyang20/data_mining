        <p>David Zee, a coastal engineer and professor of oceanography at Rio's State University, said that about 10 percent of the two-and-a-half-mile Copacabana beach had shrunk in width by 100 to 150 feet, and in Ipanema a 985-foot section of Arpoador beach has lost more than half of its 100 feet of sandy width.</p>

        <p>Chalk up another point for El Nino -- maybe. Portions of Rio's famous beaches, mainly at Copacabana, Ipanema and Leblon, are being nibbled away, and at least some scientists think El Nino is the culprit.</p>
        <p>David Zee, a coastal engineer and professor of oceanography at Rio's State University, said that about 10 percent of the two-and-a-half-mile Copacabana beach had shrunk in width by 100 to 150 feet, and in Ipanema a 985-foot section of Arpoador beach has lost more than half of its 100 feet of sandy width.</p>
        <p>Beach erosion happens regularly during El Nino, the cyclical weather pattern, said Prakki Satymurty, chief of operations at the National Institute for Space Research. But the erosion of Rio's beaches may have started even before El Nino, according to Marcio Luis Vianna, an oceanographer at the National Institute for Space Research, and may have more to do with a gradual intensification of South Atlantic winds in recent years, bringing higher and heavier waves.</p>
        <p>Mauricio Tostes Vieira, Secretary of Works for the city government, said that his office was observing the situation. ''But if necessary,'' he said, ''we will do a landfill.''</p>
