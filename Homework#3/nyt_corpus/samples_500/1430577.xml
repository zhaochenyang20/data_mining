        <p>As Tokyo markets veered down yet again today, investors bailed out, tightened their safety belts or begged the government to avoid the dreaded ''hard landing'' of bankruptcies and unemployment.</p>
        <p>But Heizo Takenaka, the new economics minister, merely confirmed what investors already knew: Japanese markets are in severe shape. And Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi rebuffed politicians' pleas by refusing to try to make a soft landing with a cushion of several trillion more yen in bonds.</p>
        <p>Foreigners were net sellers for the 13th consecutive day, helping to push the Nikkei index down almost 2 percent, to 8,539.34, a new 19-year low. Last month, according to data compiled by Reuters, foreign investors sold a net $11.3 billion worth of Japanese stocks, the largest monthly net selling since the Ministry of Finance started tracking the capital flow statistics four years ago.</p>
        <p>Investors fear that the market will continue losing altitude until the government announces a macroeconomic package, expected next week. The package is an attempt to ease the social pain of banks' calling in billions of dollars in bad loans as well as an effort to prevent a few major bankruptcies from dragging the economy into a severe recession.</p>
        <p>''If a 'hard landing' means a crash, nobody wants it, but we share a recognition that time is running out,'' said Yutaka Kosai, chairman of the Japan Center for Economic Research and head of a new task force that is meeting this week to devise a strategy to deal with nearly half a trillion dollars in bad loans.</p>
        <p>Businesspeople fear that bankers, by calling in bad loans, will set off a vicious circle of more bankruptcies, more unemployment and less consumer demand.</p>
        <p>Today, in an effort to calm the markets, Japan's finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, blamed the media. ''Japanese media were running stories as if big companies were going bankrupt and Japan is going into a big panic,'' the 80-year-old minister told reporters. ''Because of these reports, stock prices have failed to reflect the real strength of companies. I think this is very annoying, and, as a politician, I am really cross with this.''</p>
        <p>But one alarmed Japanese is from the core of the business establishment: Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of the Japan Business Federation.</p>
        <p>''I am watching with a deep sense of crisis,'' said Mr. Okuda, who is also chairman of Toyota Motor, Japan's largest company. Looking ahead to weak half-year earnings reports expected in the coming weeks, he said Monday, ''It is said that the economy has hit bottom, but judging from the reality, there are still many bad indicators around, and corporate confidence remains weak.''</p>
        <p>Japanese banks are heavily invested in corporate stocks, and the falling stock markets are battering their capital. In the last seven days of trading, latent losses on shares held by the nation's 12 largest commercial banks have jumped by 46 percent, to $41 billion, according to an estimate prepared today by the Daiwa Institute of Research.</p>
        <p>With the Nikkei index briefly dipping below 8,500 today, the capital-to-asset ratios of these banks are around 9 percent, just above the 8 percent level required for banks to operate internationally. If the Nikkei falls below 8,000, the ratios of many banks may fall below 8 percent, the institute calculates.</p>
        <p>Today, Hidenao Miyajima, an investment strategist here for Commerzbank Securities, predicted that American bottom fishers would soon appear here. He said that ''a round of bargain hunting in Japan by these U.S. investors is quite possible.''</p>
        <p>But contrarians were hard to find as selling continued to dominate.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Tokyo markets fell nearly 4 percent on reports that Mr. Takenaka said no bank or company in Japan was ''too big to fail.''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, he helped to stabilize the market by adopting a lower profile, canceling a series of interviews with the foreign financial media.</p>
        <p>''Japan has strong economic potential,'' he told a news conference for Japanese reporters. ''Share prices will be bolstered substantially if we carry out our existing policy.''</p>
        <p>According to Paul Sheard, chief Asia economist for Lehman Brothers, ''The backtracking was damage control, not a major shift in policy.''</p>
        <p>With politicians of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party said to be trying to curb Mr. Takenaka's power and block his clean-up campaign, foreigners worry that his zeal for reform will be neutralized by a hostile Parliament and bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>''Having proceeded with marginal changes, something more dramatic is in order,'' Kenneth Rogoff, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, said on a visit here today. ''There are risks to restructuring, but there are also risks to continuing to muddle through.''</p>
        <p>To reassure depositors, the government announced Monday that it was reversing a policy and extending for two years blanket insurance on bank deposits. Behind this decision was a clear fear of a run on banks in coming months.</p>
        <p>With Japan bracing for an upsurge in unemployment, some government ministers have called for a special bond issue, or supplementary budget, to pay for benefits and retraining for the jobless. Benefits were strained last year by 20,052 corporate bankruptcies, the second-highest total since World War II.</p>
        <p>But with the Japanese government the most heavily indebted of any major developed nation, government officials today discouraged talk of a ''supplementary budget.''</p>
        <p>''We are not thinking at all about increasing bond issuances,'' Yasuo Fukuda, the chief cabinet secretary, said.</p>
