        <p>LEAD: On Monday the Upjohn Company is to give the Food and Drug Administration the results of its tests on Rogaine, a product the company wants to sell as a baldness remedy. But the application for approval by the F.D.A. has prompted sharp criticism from the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer organization that has accused Upjohn of trying to ''make bald people feel insecure.</p>
        <p>On Monday the Upjohn Company is to give the Food and Drug Administration the results of its tests on Rogaine, a product the company wants to sell as a baldness remedy. But the application for approval by the F.D.A. has prompted sharp criticism from the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer organization that has accused Upjohn of trying to ''make bald people feel insecure.''</p>
        <p>Upjohn has defended its activities concerning Rogaine, which originally was developed as minoxidil, a drug to treat high blood pressure.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, head of the Health Research Group, said Upjohn had been preparing the way for the sale of Rogaine to the public by issuing press releases under the letterhead of an organization it formed, Hair Awareness Information and Research, or HAIR.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wolfe read from one release, titled ''Psychological Aspects of Hair Loss,'' which said, ''Can an emerging bald spot, or even a noticeably receding hairline, damage your ability to get along with others, influence your chances of obtaining a job or even interfere with your job performance?''</p>
        <p>The release quoted H.Hugh Floyd Jr., a professor of sociology at the University of New Orleans, as saying, ''Losing one's hair can have tremendous psychological influence and definitely affects self-confidence and self-assurance.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Wolfe asserted that Upjohn was engaging in a ''sleazy, shameless prepromotional campaign to make bald people feel as bad as possible'' and to encourage them to use Rogaine, a liquid applied to the scalp, if it is approved for sale.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Upjohn, Jan R. AufderHeide, said there was nothing negative about the campaign. ''It was informational, not promotional,'' she said. ''This is a common practice to inform and educate the public.''</p>
        <p>Rogaine has generated more consumer interest, as measured by letters and telephone calls, than any other product in the 101-year history of Upjohn, she added.</p>
        <p>Rogaine is safe and effective, Miss AufderHeide said. In a yearlong test of 1,833 bald men, she said, 40 percent reported moderate hair growth after using the product. Doctors examining the men reported that among 76 percent of them, one or more new hairs had grown in a one-inch circle at the crown of the head, Miss AufderHeide said.</p>
        <p>The findings also will state, she said, that there was no significant difference in the blood pressure, pulse rate or weight of men using Rogaine and those who used a placebo.</p>
        <p>It is not known how long it will take the Government to act on Upjohn's application. Just What's Beer?  What is beer? A Federal statute does not address what its alcohol content should be, and two Federal agencies have differed on whether a beverage without alcohol can rightly be called beer.</p>
        <p>The Federal Trade Commission has recommended that the makers of malt beverages be permitted to call their products beer, ale, lager, stout or porter, even if all or most of the alcohol has been removed. But the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has proposed that the use of the word beer and related terms continue to be forbidden for beverages that have less than 0.5 percent alcohol.</p>
        <p>''The only purpose of this restriction,'' the F.T.C. asserted in its recommendation, ''appears to be to protect consumers from purchasing this product . . . on the mistaken belief that they are buying an alcoholic beverage.'' Rather than protecting drinkers of alcoholic beverages, the agency said, the restrictions ''are likely to harm consumers who are seeking healthier and safer substitutes by depriving them of valuable information concerning the alternative of nonalcoholic beer.''</p>
        <p>Under the bureau's proposed regulation, beerlike nonalcoholic drinks would have to be called malt beverages, cereal beverages or near beer.</p>
        <p>The brewers of nonalcoholic beer, the F.T.C. staff said, are unlikely to try to sell their product as containing alcohol because such beverages are geared to consumers who want to reduce their consumption of alcohol. Their marketing, the staff said, emphasizes the absence of alcohol.</p>
        <p>The importers of Moussy, which is brewed in Switzerland, are opposing the bureau's proposal, which would continue to require that Moussy, which has virtually no alcohol, be labeled a malt beverage.</p>
        <p>''We would like to call it nonalcoholic beer,'' said Myles J. Ambrose, a lawyer representing the importer.</p>
        <p>Supporting the bureau is the Beer Institute, which represents breweries whose beverages have the normal alcohol content of 3 to 4 percent and those who make the newer low-alcohol beers with less than 2.5 percent. The institute wants those beverages to be the only ones entitled to be called beer; to do otherwise would confuse consumers, it said.</p>
