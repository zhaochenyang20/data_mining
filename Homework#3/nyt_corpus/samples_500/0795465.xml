        <p>PARKING Delivered, Presumably, Dent-Free In a test run in Augsburg, Germany, an automatic rotating disc brought three cars to their parking slots. The promised waiting time at this fancy new garage: 2.5 minutes PUBLISHING  Those Business Week Papers Let's see. First Procter &amp; Gamble sued Bankers Trust, saying it had been led down a too-risky investment path. A mass of papers quickly piled up -- lawyers tend to be good at that -- and a judge decided some of them weren't quite ready for public consumption. Then Business Week got hold of the sealed papers and smelled a scoop, a judge said no, and all sorts of First Amendment hell broke loose. Last week some smoke cleared, as the judge unsealed the documents, which seemed to bolster P.&amp;G.'s case by disclosing losses at other companies from derivatives sold by Bankers Trust. But the free-speech issue was left smoldering, for the judge also insisted he had the right to stop publication. Now it's in the lap of the appeals courts.  CHARITY  Throwing Big Money at Cancer  It's all too familiar these days: a takeover, a merger, a little board-room back-scratching, and some executive walks away with a sum that would boggle the mind even if it lost a couple of zeroes. But last week came a stunning variation: the mind-numbing sum was going not to an executive but to science. Jon Huntsman, who made about $1 billion in chemicals, lost both parents to cancer and battled it twice himself. That was enough to prod him to say he'd give $100 million to a cancer research center at the University of Utah. That may be walking-around money to Ted Turner, but it's the largest individual gift ever to medical research. "It's been 26 years since a man walked on the moon," Mr. Huntsman said, and we're still battling cancer. He wants to win this one. AUTOS  Speaking Out at Chrysler  The seat belts are off at Chrysler. Last week the chairman, Robert Eaton, lashed out at those he said wanted to "trash" the company -- mainly Kirk Kerkorian and Jerome York. He said Mr. Kerkorian, who now owns nearly 15 percent of Chrysler, "has no real knowledge" about what's happening and is merely out for "personal gain." He said Mr. Kerkorian and Mr. York -- the former Chrysler executive who's now in Mr. Kerkorian's camp -- are merely harming other shareholders by trying to gain control.</p>
        <p>REAL ESTATE  Japanese for 'Low Rent'  Japanese real estate prices are so high they're almost an international joke (so long as someone else is paying them). So when you hear that they've plummeted -- by two-thirds or more -- in recent years, does that mean they're out of the stratosphere? Not exactly. You'll still spend $6,000 or so (every month!) to rent a modest suburban house, perhaps $4,000 for a one-bedroom Tokyo apartment; this is Japanese for "plummet." And it may not even last. Last week the I.M.F. forecast a recovery for the battered Japanese economy in 1996, though it did lower its estimate for the nation's growth this year. Rent 'em while you can. CAREERS  The Mailroom Gambit  It is, so it's said, the American way: if you're near the top of your field, you make a good living. So you'd think that Jay Bonin, who's in the top 200 or so Americans in his chosen field, would be riding high. If he'd been a lawyer, he might have been one of the hundreds of that profession at the Simpson defense table; if he played baseball, he'd be out there spitting with the richest of them. But Mr. Bonin's great talent is chess. Yes, there's $1 million in prize money in the world championship match that was speeding toward a conclusion last week atop the World Trade Center, but in chess, if you're not at that pinnacle, you'd better have a day job. Mr. Bonin, brilliant at chess, makes a few thousand a year at it; by day, he's a mailroom clerk. INNOVATIONS  Making Cats Easier to Love  There are, those tireless statisticians tell us, 63 million cats in this country. There'd be a lot fewer if it weren't for one Edward Lowe. Cats, you see, smell. Built for the desert, they use water with enviable efficiency, but the downside is that their urine . . . well, you know. To fight the odor, people tried sawdust, sand, wood shavings, but they weren't much help. Then one day in 1947 -- a watershed day in feline history -- Mr. Lowe had a neighbor try a dried, granulated clay used to sop up grease spills in factories. And, yes, Kitty Litter was born -- along with what is now a $600 million annual industry. And Mr. Lowe? In 1990 he sold his business for $200 million. And last week he died at age 75. OPPORTUNITIES  Gulps of Premium Juice  Who has the most impact on this marvelous capitalist machine we inhabit? Well, one week it might be Bill Gates, the next week Newt Gingrich, and the next, Steven Spielberg. Last week, of course, it was 12 faceless jurors in a Los Angeles courtroom. They spoke, and this mighty economy -- which prides itself on packing every second chock full -- ground to a halt for long, long minutes. You could have heard a stock drop, if any had been trading; you could have heard the phone ring, if anyone had called. The jurors spoke, and whole conglomerates were born -- reported $1 million sales of photos of the reunion of the defendant (what was his name?) and his children, tales of $50 million pay-per-view blowout interviews, other interview deals, book deals, and then probably books about the book deals. And, yes, talk of a television drama series based on the lives of two DNA experts. And it's only just begun.  HEALTH CARE  Medicare Plan Under Fire  Medicare may well need patching up, but the Republicans' notions about how to do it took a lot of flak last week. First came the American Medical Association, which has kept silent for much of the recent debate but now voiced concern that limits on payments would scare too many doctors away. "It would be a major blow," said an A.M.A. spokesman. Then the A.A.R.P. joined the fray, saying Congress was cutting "too much, too fast" from projected spending. Newt Gingrich has been trying to get the elderly on his side, but he doesn't seem to have succeeded. And in a final attack, the head of the American College of Physicians said bluntly, "We are not on board."</p>
