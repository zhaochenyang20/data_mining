        <p>LIKE the whisper of the pines that tower around her churches, Pastor Susan Flicker speaks softly of things in a community that are everlasting. In so doing, she is breathing life and spirit back into a half-dozen towns in South Jersey.</p>
        <p>She has visions, speaks often to the Almighty and gets answers that she shares with her congregations. She has turned areas populated with the introverted, isolated and often underprivileged into New Jersey's version of Mayberry or perhaps  ''Touched by an Angel.''</p>

        <p>LIKE the whisper of the pines that tower around her churches, Pastor Susan Flicker speaks softly of things in a community that are everlasting. In so doing, she is breathing life and spirit back into a half-dozen towns in South Jersey.</p>
        <p>She has visions, speaks often to the Almighty and gets answers that she shares with her congregations. She has turned areas populated with the introverted, isolated and often underprivileged into New Jersey's version of Mayberry or perhaps  ''Touched by an Angel.''</p>
        <p>Pastor Flicker, 50, has an old-world approach to modern-day life, matching her ministry to her four historic churches that were founded in 1808, 1823 1847 and 1875.</p>
        <p>Ms. Flicker is on call 24 hours a day for counseling, visiting hospitals and attending events from piano recitals to soccer games. ''It is important that people here know that I am interested in them and the lives they lead outside our church walls,'' she said. ''This is not a maintenance ministry.''</p>
        <p>She graduated from Thomas Edison College in Trenton with a bachelor's degree in history and took her first job as director of the Country Day Nursery School in St. Lawrence, Pa., in the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>Always interested in being a caretaker of others, she left for a job at Caring Inc. of Atlantic County, setting up group homes for the elderly and running a day care center.</p>
        <p>A divorced mother of two grown sons, Pastor Sue, as she is known throughout the Pine Barrens, dabbled in several careers. But when her sons graduated high school,  she entered Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wynnwood, Pa.</p>
        <p>After graduating in 1990, she gave up on her more lucrative endeavors for a job that paid less than $12,000 a year -- part-time pastor at the First United Methodist Church of Batsto. When the job became full time a year ago, she was raised to $22,000.</p>
        <p>''It's not about money,'' she said. ''It is a pure joy to go with people on the journey through their lives from baptisms to marriages and into death. You can't pay someone to do that. They do that for something more than money.''</p>
        <p>Born and reared in Wilmington, Del., and later a resident of Ocean City, she wanted to minister to inner-city youths. Instead, she was assigned a parish in the Pines.</p>
        <p>''I did wonder what God was thinking,'' Ms. Flicker said. ''But he knew me better than I knew myself. I have a heart for people. I can feel their pain. I've been there myself. There is brokenness in my life that has healed. Because of that I can see people's pain and help them handle it.''</p>
        <p>She will not speak of her marriage except to say that it was a painful part of her life until she divorced in 1980.</p>
        <p>She spoke of a host of other things, though, on a hot August afternoon, during an interview at the old Batsto church, where the wooden pews were hewn in 1808 and an ancient, potbellied stove sits like a large black bear.</p>
        <p>Unlike modern places of worship where electric candles flare, this church smells of freshly melted beeswax, oily wood soap and maybe just a hint of brimstone.</p>
        <p>Ms. Flicker pointed to the cracks in the whitewashed walls and told of the days in the 1930's when legions of bees made their home behind the walls. Honey dripped from the cracks and onto the wooden floorboards. The congregation then worked together to collect this ambrosia for bottling and sale to support the parish.</p>
        <p>Ms. Flicker is loathe to take credit for her works saying: ''I'm not doing this. What is happening here, in these communities, is happening because people are working together.''</p>
        <p>Before she became their leader nine years ago, the Methodist churches in Egg Harbor City, Lower Bank, Green Bank, Mullica, South Hampton, Sicklerville and Wading River were nearly empty. Some congregations numbered in the single digits.</p>
        <p>The pastor took fading churches -- Batsto, Nesco, Green Bank and Lower Bank United Methodist -- and linked them to one pastor: herself. The combination of parishes is called the United Methodist Pinelands Charge.</p>
        <p>Her residents say she gave them a sense of focus, community and empowerment.  Ask her to talk about herself and the answer is: ''I'm nobody. I spent my life as a mother and went through a lot of careers before I heard the call to the ministry.''</p>
        <p>One son, 30-year-old Michael, who lives in Hickory, N.C., where he is an athletic trainer, said in a telephone interview that he supported his mother's choice of careers.</p>
        <p>She even performed his wedding ceremony to his wife, Karen, three years ago at the church here. ''That made the vows even more special,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He added: ''My brother Scott and I used to joke that it was hard to go away to college and leave a regular Mom at home and come back to a preacher. You try and find a support group for that.''</p>
        <p>She acts as a cross between a mother and a sort of air traffic controller for the soul. Ms. Flicker has every member of her flock on the radar screen. She can recite phone numbers, birthdays, anniversaries, names of uncles who are ailing and babies who were born.</p>
        <p>She is constantly helping parishioners  with everything from meals to mental health. All through the hot, dusty summer she worked with blueberry farmers who were angry with God over the drought.</p>
        <p>''They just needed someone to tell them not to give up,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She has counseled workers who lost jobs when three major businesses (a boat works, a cookie factory and Whitehall-Robbins Inc.) closed their doors.</p>
        <p>Residents say several of them were in the grip of searing poverty, self-doubt, alcoholism, drug addiction and in many cases,  abuse from their husbands. Others were simply marking time until the day they would add to the number at the town cemetery.</p>
        <p>''Her presence has strengthened the ties between the churches in our communities,' said Linda Thibault, 50, of Nesco.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thibault added: ''I've lived here my whole life and I've been going to the Batsto Church since I was two years old. I've never seen someone like her.''</p>
        <p>People who live deep in the Pines are known for their reclusive ways. Indeed, some live so far in the woods that they have never seen a neighbor's home.</p>
        <p>''She taught us to reach out to each other and not be so inward looking,'' Ms. Thibault said. ''She taught us to see a brighter future than we ever imagined. Parents' groups, youth groups, grief support, fund drives for the needy, outreach programs and a food closet -- who would have dreamed we could do that?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Flicker works extensively with abused women, substance abusers, teen-age rebels and the elderly. She also has prison ministries at the Atlantic County Jail in Mays Landing and at the Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, where she helps inmates and their families cope with their problems and plan for the future. She is also  on call to minister to the William B. Kessler Hospital in Hammonton.</p>
        <p>A large part of her work consists of helping couples prepare for marriage, and it is there that her approach is most unique.</p>
        <p>''When we came to Pastor Sue three years ago to get ready for our marriage, she worked with us for about six months,'' said  Karen Barnett, 42, of Sweetwater. ''She had us write a covenant of things we would do together in the marriage. That really floored me.''</p>
        <p>Brutal honesty and in-depth research into couples' personalities and understanding of each other is the mainstay of her pre-marital counseling sessions. With her help, couples say they were more prepared for the bumps in the marital road.</p>
        <p>''If she doesn't think the marriage will work, she will tell you point-blank,'' said Mrs. Barnett. ''If she sees character conflicts or flaws she makes you see them so that years down the road you can't claim to be surprised.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Barnett explained that the Batsto Church and the others were in dire financial straits when the pastor arrived. Members desperately wanted to make Ms. Flicker a full-time pastor but could not afford to pay or house her. None of the churches had a parsonage she could call home.</p>
        <p>''We just all got together and decided to go ahead with it all on faith,'' Mrs. Barnett said. ''Oh, there were those who yelled and screamed all the way that it couldn't be done. They're not saying that now.''</p>
        <p>When the district superintendent for the Methodist Churches wanted to reassign Ms. Flicker two years ago, members of the churches banded together to change his mind. ''We won, and then we had to find the money,'' Mrs. Barnett said.</p>
        <p>To hear church members tell it, faith in their pastor didn't move mountains, but it certainly did move loan officers and grant committees. The parsonage was bought on a mortgage, and the United Methodist Council gave them an $8,000 grant. With attendance at all the churches increasing, the collections went up as well.</p>
        <p>They started a food closet for the needy. Last month, the new parish youth group raised money for a local man suffering from pancreatic cancer by making a parade float that won a $500 prize. Now the members of these United Methodist churches are working on new dreams, like a community center and a nature center for the Pine Barrens.</p>
        <p>''Bottom line here -- if you have a dream and you can accomplish it alone then you didn't dream big enough,'' Mrs. Barnett said. ''If you have a dream so big that you all have to work together, then it's of God. We had to step out there together and take some chances. We would have never done that without Pastor Sue to guide us.''</p>
        <p>Four Historic Churches, Rocks of the Ages</p>
        <p>THERE are places in New Jersey where the hand of time has been stayed. In the southern part of the state, four historic churches still stand as markers in the book of the ages.</p>
        <p>Tours of the four churches are available through the Ocean County Historical Society in Toms River. For information, call (732) 341-1880.</p>
        <p>LOWER  BANK  METHODIST  CHURCH  The trustees bought the land for its construction from Levi Johnson in 1874 for $75 and the cornerstone was placed the next year.</p>
        <p>GREEN  BANK  UNITED  METHODIST  CHURCH  Around 1740, the Rev. Samuel Driver came to the banks of the Mullica River. Clearing some acreage on its highest bank, he built a log cabin. Upon his death in 1748, his home became the local church and his burial on the land marked the beginning of the Green Bank Church and Cemetery. The current church was built in 1823 by Nicholas Sooy. He willed the church to his four sons and their descendants to be used as a Methodist church ''only and forever.''</p>
        <p>BATSTO-PLEASANT  MILLS  UNITED  METHODIST  CHURCH  The original church was constructed by Scottish Covenanters (Presbyterians), who settled at Pleasant Mills. According to the Scottish tradition, the church was the first structure built in town and was put up between sunrise and sunset the same day.</p>
        <p>The original church was a log cabin with thatched roof and a packed earthen floor. It was replaced in 1760 by Capt. Elijah Clark with a new building of squared logs, a shingled roof and a wooden floor. By 1808, the increased activity at Batsto Furnace brought about a need for more space to serve the growing village. When the first Methodist bishop of the United States, Francis Asbury, visited Batsto in 1808 he advised the congregation to rebuild and enlarge the church. Construction was completed in r 1808, and the church has been in use since then.</p>
        <p>NEW  COLUMBIA  (NESCO) UNITED  METHODIST  CHURCH  This church was built in 1847 on land donated by Jesse and Sarah Richards of Batsto.</p>
        <p>The next tour is scheduled for Sept. 15. The cost is $35.</p>
