        <p>Appropriately and perhaps adeptly, David Cone will be the first Yankee to pitch in an interleague skirmish when New York opposes the Florida Marlins in Miami tonight.

        <p>Over and over yesterday, Cone repeated his sermon about the tingly feelings he expects to experience and expects others to feel now that clubs from baseball's opposite leagues are playing games before the World Series for the first time.

        <p>Appropriately and perhaps adeptly, David Cone will be the first Yankee to pitch in an interleague skirmish when New York opposes the Florida Marlins in Miami tonight. But if you listen to Cone discuss the event, he sounds more like a public relations director for the virtues of the American League against the National League than a pitcher in a historic game.</p>
        <p>Over and over yesterday, Cone repeated his sermon about the tingly feelings he expects to experience and expects others to feel now that clubs from baseball's opposite leagues are playing games before the World Series for the first time. Cone sounded like a super flak who is a super fan.</p>
        <p>''I think the fans are going to make it special,'' said Cone. ''You're going to have a lot of electricity in the stands. The fans are going to be into it. To me, fans can dictate the atmosphere. They can make it a playoff-type atmosphere. They can pump up players.''</p>
        <p>Not every player shared Cone's sentiments.</p>
        <p>''It's just another game,'' said Mariano Rivera. ''It doesn't matter.''</p>
        <p>An unfazed Cecil Fielder added: ''I'm not overjoyed about it. It's on the schedule so you go play.''</p>
        <p>But while several of Cone's teammates called the journey to Pro Player Stadium just another trip in a long season, the pitcher insisted there was something important about tonight's contest and something extraordinary about the three-game series with the Mets that begins Monday night at Yankee Stadium. Cone claimed fans will love the new matchups and he made an astounding 16 references to fans in a 10-minute interview. Such lavish attention to fans has not been voiced since an overzealous 12-year-old poked his glove over the right-field fence for a huge impact on last year's American League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>''There's an element of excitement in the air,'' said Cone, who will oppose Al Leiter, a former Yankee. ''I think the fans are into this experiment. I think the excitement will be up. I think the attendance will be up.''</p>
        <p>Cone has that right, for all three games in Miami this weekend and all three at Yankee Stadium next week are sold out. The Marlins have been averaging 28,229 fans a game, but the interleague contests will average 41,855, an inflation that was surely influenced by the Yankees' having trained in nearby Fort Lauderdale, Fla., from 1962 to 1995. The Yankees have averaged 25,369, but the encounters with the rival Mets in the Bronx will average 57,545.</p>
        <p>''If you're a Yankee or a Met fan, you've been waiting for this for your whole life,'' said Joe Girardi, looking to Monday.</p>
        <p>But before the Yankees tangle with the Mets in the series that George Steinbrenner -- and Steinbrenner alone -- probably considers the most pivotal of the season, they must tussle with Florida. The Marlins (37-26), who are in second place in the National League East, have a better record than the defending World Series champion Yankees (36-27), who are second in the American League East. But the records are not relevant.</p>
        <p>''There are Yankee fans everywhere we go,'' said Cone. ''You know there will be a lot of transplanted New Yorkers there.''</p>
        <p>Cone is the perfect pitcher in this spot because he has a National League background from six years with the Mets and because attention-grabbing games never bother him. But it might bother him to bat in a National League park; the last time he did that in a regular-season game was Aug. 23, 1992. Cone, who had 61 hits in 395 at-bats (.154 average) for the Mets, is not predicting miracles.</p>
        <p>''The most important thing is getting down a bunt,'' Cone said. ''The chances of our pitchers getting a hit is pretty remote.''</p>
        <p>There will be no designated hitter in the series, so Manager Joe Torre has the ticklish choice of picking between Fielder and Tino Martinez at first base. Since Leiter is the only left-hander starting for Florida, the right-handed Fielder (1 for 12 off Leiter) might start over Martinez (1 for 9) tonight.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a fan of this,'' said Torre. ''But I think it's going to be electric out there. I think the fans are going to be into it. As much against it as I am, I think this stuff is going to be fun.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>General Manager BOB WATSON said DARRYL STRAWBERRY, who is testing his injured left knee at Class AAA Columbus, would not be activated this weekend. While Strawberry slugged a pair of homers in his first three games, he is still running cautiously because of inflamed cartilage and seems doubtful for the series with the Mets. . . . TIM RAINES (strained left hamstring) can be activated Tuesday and said he would join the Yankees on Sunday.</p>
