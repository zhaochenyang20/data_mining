        <p>Federal bank regulators today seized the Madison National Bank, one of the largest in the Washington area, after declaring it insolvent.</p>
        <p>Madison is to be sold to Signet Bank for $18 million.</p>
        <p>Banking officials estimated that the failure of Madison would ultimately cost the fund that insures deposits almost $150 million. All depositors, even those with uninsured accounts of more than $100,000, will be protected. Madison's shareholders will lose their investments.</p>
        <p>The move caps three years of problems at the bank, which had an unusually high concentration of loans for real estate and construction and had been unable to comply with regulatory standards.</p>
        <p>Trying to keep Madison afloat, regulators last year permitted the bank to borrow heavily from the Federal Reserve. But the borrowing could not offset the mounting losses on loans to real estate developers and to many of the bank's executives, and the losses eventually exceeded the bank's capital.</p>
        <p>"The downturn in the local economy contributed to the bank's problems," the office of the Comptroller of the Currency said in a statement released today. "But Madison National Bank's poor underwriting standards, including making unsecured real estate loans, providing 100 percent financing of real estate projects, and lending based on character rather than cash flow, were major causes of the bank's failure."</p>
        <p>The banking company is the sixth largest in Washington. It had assets of $529 million as of Dec. 31.</p>
