        <p>WHEN a court-appointed panel made its recommendation on school financing three weeks ago, it was as if New York City schools had hit the jackpot. The panel reported that an additional $5.6 billion should be spent on city schools each year and that $9.2 billion worth of new classrooms, laboratories, libraries and other facilities were needed to provide what a judge has ruled was the state's constitutional obligation to provide ''a sound, basic education.''</p>
        <p>The recommendation was a major victory for the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the advocacy group that sued the state a decade ago on behalf of the city's public school students.</p>
        <p>But there was no joy in the suburbs. Though no decision has been made about where the extra billions would come from, many experts agree that a sizable chunk of it would have to come from Nassau and Suffolk Counties.</p>
        <p>Long Island residents already pay some of the highest property taxes in the country, and now, anticipating a statewide review of school aid policy, some local officials and advocates are making the case that Long Island should not be subsidizing other parts of the state.</p>
        <p>''I think that Nassau County is somehow getting shortchanged on school aid,'' said Howard Weitzman, the county comptroller. He said he had been studying Nassau County as well as Suffolk and New York City's northern suburbs for a report that he plans to send in the next few days to local and state lawmakers.</p>
        <p>According to the report, Nassau County school districts in 2001-2 spent an average of $16,838 per student, with 16.6 percent of revenues coming from the state. Suffolk County, the report says, spent $15,997 per student and relied on the state for about 20 percent of school financing.</p>
        <p>New York City spent $12,169 per student, with 43.3 percent of revenues from the state, well above the state average, 37.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Mitchell H. Pally, the vice president for government affairs at the Long Island Association, said Long Island residents had long been making up for shortfalls in state aid to their own schools by increasing local taxes. But the city has not been making up the difference, he said, and Long Island should not be penalized for doing what New York should have been doing all along.</p>
        <p>''The inadequacy of the funding is not based on the fact that New York State does not give them enough money,'' he said. ''It's based on the fact that New York City doesn't give their own schools enough money.''</p>
        <p>The Long Island Association calculated that if all the $5.6 billion were financed by city residents, the percentage of income that they would pay in local taxes would end up only slightly greater than the percentage Long Island residents pay now.</p>
        <p>City officials want the state to pick up the cost of the panel's recommendation, arguing that inadequate school financing is not the city's fault.</p>
        <p>''It's not just that we educate 38 percent of the kids and we only get 34 percent of the total dollar figure," said Eva Moskowitz, a councilwoman in Manhattan. ''We also have a student population that has many more educational needs.'' City pupils are more likely to live in poverty, lack prekindergarten schooling or be learning English, she said.</p>
        <p>The panel's recommendation said the city's burden could not be ''arbitrary or unreasonable,'' but the battle has already started over what unreasonable means. Governor Pataki has suggested that the city contribute 40 percent, and some, like Steven Sanders of Manhattan, the head of the State Assembly's Education Committee, have said that 25 percent is a reasonable compromise.</p>
        <p>But Edmund J. McMahon of the Manhattan Institute said that ultimately any solution would be costly to Long Island.</p>
        <p>''Any set of circumstances that is putting more fiscal pressure on the state of New York and even on the city of New York ultimately is bad news for Long Island,'' said.</p>
        <p>Even if the state pays only 60 percent of the $5.6 billion, that still means a yearly state layout of almost $3.4 billion. In one likely scenario, Mr. McMahon said, legislators would demand that their districts' proportions of aid remain the same.</p>
        <p>With New York City receiving about a third of the state's aid to public schools, this would mean that the entire state aid budget would increase by around $8 billion. Paying for that would require tax increases, Mr. McMahon said, and higher income taxes will hit hard on Long Island, with its disproportionate share of above-average incomes.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the state might decide to rearrange the proportions, forcing wealthier school districts to make up for lost state aid with higher property taxes. That would also affect Long Island residents, whose property values are higher than the state average.</p>
        <p>Anticipating the panel's recommendation, the Citizens Budget Commission issued a report in November exploring other options for financing, like taxing gambling receipts, broadening the state sales tax to cover more goods and services and eliminating waste. But all these measures taken together would probably not prevent some form of tax increase, the report said.</p>
        <p>A formula devised by the commission found that, if the entire $5.6 billion were financed solely by an increase in the state sales tax, the tax would jump to 6.8 percent from the current 4 percent. If it were financed solely by an income tax increase, a family with an income of around $60,000 would pay about $685 more a year.</p>
        <p>''It's inevitably going to involve redistribution,'' said Charles Brecher, a research director at the commission.</p>
        <p>But Michael A. Rebell, executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, said he was working to make sure no district received less financing than it was receiving now.</p>
        <p>He said that the New York City shortfall was only part of the bigger picture, which includes needy Long Island districts like Brentwood, Roosevelt and Wyandanch. A study by Mr. Rebell's organization and allied groups lists 517 of the state's 698 school districts, 41 of them on Long Island, as inadequately financed.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Rebell met in Albany with education advocates, policy makers and school officials from around the state to work on legislation that would commit $8.5 billion more annually to schools statewide.</p>
        <p>The financial discrepancy Long Island from district to district is why Mr. Brecher said it was impossible to make simple conclusions about the impact of the panel's recommendation.</p>
        <p>Wealthy districts like Great Neck can have high tax revenues per student without high tax rates because much of the property in the district is so expensive and there is a significant commercial base. As a result, Great Neck received only 11 percent of its revenue in state aid, according to a Citizens' Budget Commission report for the 2001-2 school year.</p>
        <p>Poorer districts with small commercial districts, like Roosevelt, are in a double bind, with higher-than-average tax rates but below-average tax revenues per student. Even though state aid made up 64 percent of Roosevelt's revenues, the Campaign for Fiscal Equity said the district needed a 40 percent increase in financing to reach adequate levels.</p>
        <p>''I think there's a general demand that the problems are not limited to New York City in terms of funding,'' said Thomas P. DiNapoli of Thomaston, the leader of the Island's delegation in the State Assembly. ''The worst result would be a New York City-only solution. I tend to think it won't come to that, but who knows?''</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 26, 2004, Sunday  An article on Dec. 19 about Long Island school districts' concerns over a proposed reformulation of state aid to education misstated the Nassau County comptroller's calculation of state aid as a percentage of Suffolk public schools' revenues. It is 29.8 percent, not 20 percent.</p>
