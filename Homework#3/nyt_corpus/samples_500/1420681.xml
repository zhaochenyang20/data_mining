        <p>The high point -- make that the low point -- of ''The American Way of Death'' is Jessica Mitford's account of a friend's attempt to bury a relative without spending a fortune. When the friend asked for an inexpensive redwood coffin, the funeral home agreed at first. But the salesman called back to say the deceased was too tall, and she had to buy a coffin that cost $100 more. When Ms. Mitford's friend balked, the salesman responded, ''Oh, all right, we'll use the redwood one, but we'll have to cut off his feet.''</p>
        <p>This summer it feels as if big business is letting us down as never before. But corporate scandals have been a part of American history since the Yazoo land fraud of 1795. Thirty-nine years ago Ms. Mitford exposed one of the most jaw-dropping of all: the great funeral industry scandal of 1963. Her findings, acerbically set forth in her surprise best seller, hold some important lessons for today's reformers.</p>
        <p>This unlikely scandal was set off by an unlikely crusader. One of six daughters of the Baron of Redesdale, Ms. Mitford left the British aristocracy behind and married Bob Treuhaft, an Oakland trade-union lawyer. From him she learned that when working men died, their hard-won death benefits -- intended to support their widows and children -- invariably ended up in the pockets of unscrupulous undertakers.</p>
        <p>On the trail of injustice, Ms. Mitford made undercover visits to funeral parlors and pored over back issues of Casket &amp; Sunnyside -- and the rest is muckraking history. ''The American Way of Death'' soared to the top of the New York Times best-seller list, and ignited a firestorm. CBS turned it into an hourlong documentary, and newspapers from New York to San Francisco investigated local funeral practices. Ms. Mitford's encounters with shady undertakers and cemetery plot salesmen led her to some conclusions that apply to today's corporate scandals, or most likely soon will:</p>
        <p>1. Never underestimate corporate greed. Before her book came out, funeral directors presented themselves as humble comforters of the bereaved. But Ms. Mitford showed that they charged more to bury 1.7 million Americans a year than universities charged to educate 3.6 million.</p>
        <p>Many observers of today's scandals have been shocked by how far rich people will go to become richer. Bernard Ebbers, who took in more than $46 million at WorldCom, still grabbed nearly a million shares of hot I.P.O. stock, possibly illegally. Martha Stewart, who is worth a good fraction of a billion dollars, took the time to personally trade -- perhaps using insider information -- a few thousand shares of ImClone stock. Having met prosperous businessmen who would threaten to cut off a loved one's feet to make a few more bucks, Ms. Mitford would not have been a bit surprised.</p>
        <p>2. Corporate crooks often tell us exactly what they're doing. Much of ''The American Way of Death'' is simply excerpts from the funeral industry's own publications. (The book ''Successful Funeral Management'' warned undertakers not to line up coffins by price, since it made it too easy for the grieving family to comparison shop.) So it is with the current scandal, where the most damning evidence is in many cases the wrongdoers' own words. Wall Street analysts issued ''buy'' recommendations while yukking it up in internal e-mails that the stocks were junk. C.E.O.'s made bullish pronouncements, duping their shareholders and employees, while filling out forms to sell their own stock. When their words are quoted back to them in legal indictments, it will be akin to what Ms. Mitford retorted to funeral directors who complained about her book: She could not see why they were unhappy, since it was ''almost entirely given over to expounding their point of view.''</p>
        <p>3. Sometimes it isn't just the bad apples. President Bush has tried to argue that the misdeeds of Enron, WorldCom and the rest are ethical lapses of a few bad actors, and that the solution is criminal prosecutions. But the point of ''The American Way of Death'' is that the funeral industry as a whole was corrupt. ''This would normally be the place to say . . . 'I am not, of course, speaking of the vast majority of ethical undertakers,' '' Ms. Mitford wrote in the foreword. ''But the vast majority of ethical undertakers is precisely the subject of this book.'' The only solution, she insisted -- as reformers today must -- was sweeping reform.</p>
        <p>4. Reform comes slowly. For those hoping for meaningful reform now, the funeral experience is sobering. When ''The American Way of Death'' came out in 1963, the public was outraged. But despite a flood of angry letters, it took the Federal Trade Commission until 1972 to begin an investigation. It was 12 more years before it adopted -- over strenuous industry lobbying -- a rule instituting some of the reforms Ms. Mitford had recommended.</p>
        <p>The new rule required funeral homes, but not cemeteries, to itemize services and costs in advance so consumers could decide which they wanted. Still, when Ms. Mitford died in 1996, much of her agenda had been blocked. The Senate held hearings this summer on a bill, to be introduced later this month, that would, among other things, require cemeteries to itemize costs -- just in time for the 40th anniversary of Ms. Mitford's explosive little book.</p>
