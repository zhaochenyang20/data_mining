      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on recent triple-digit temperatures in New York notes that there was little relief to be gained by leaving city and that main recourse, air conditioning, failed in some areas due to electrical overload; says city's discomfort offers unpleasant reminder that if globe continues to warm, such heat waves may become common</p>

        <p>It took several calamitous accidents to persuade Congress and the commercial aviation industry to develop a radar system to detect wind shear, the severe downdrafts that cause airplanes to lose control. That system is now in use or scheduled to be built nationwide -- except in New York, where politics and bureaucratic infighting in Washington have stalled the installation of devices that can give air traffic controllers advance warning.</p>
        <p>Wind shear was implicated in the 1975 crash of an airliner approaching Kennedy Airport, a disaster in which 112 people perished. This tragedy, as well as others near New Orleans in 1982 and at Dallas in 1985, persuaded Congress to finance more than 40 Doppler weather radar systems for air terminals. The 38 in operation today and 6 under development will give the nation another defense against wind shear. Unfortunately, 24 years after the 1975 crash and nearly a decade since the device became available, there is no wind-shear radar for Kennedy or La Guardia airports.</p>

        <p>It took several calamitous accidents to persuade Congress and the commercial aviation industry to develop a radar system to detect wind shear, the severe downdrafts that cause airplanes to lose control. That system is now in use or scheduled to be built nationwide -- except in New York, where politics and bureaucratic infighting in Washington have stalled the installation of devices that can give air traffic controllers advance warning.</p>
        <p>Wind shear was implicated in the 1975 crash of an airliner approaching Kennedy Airport, a disaster in which 112 people perished. This tragedy, as well as others near New Orleans in 1982 and at Dallas in 1985, persuaded Congress to finance more than 40 Doppler weather radar systems for air terminals. The 38 in operation today and 6 under development will give the nation another defense against wind shear. Unfortunately, 24 years after the 1975 crash and nearly a decade since the device became available, there is no wind-shear radar for Kennedy or La Guardia airports.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's Senator Alfonse D'Amato blocked the Federal Aviation Administration's effort to install two wind-shear radars in Nassau County, his home turf and the heart of his political base, to serve Kennedy and La Guardia. Congress then directed the F.A.A. to install a single radar system for both airports somewhere else. Now the F.A.A. and the Department of the Interior are deadlocked over the F.A.A.'s alternative plan. The F.A.A. wants to install the wind-shear radar tower on a 1.8-acre Brooklyn site inside the 1,539 acres of Floyd Bennett Field. The airfield in turn is part of the 26,000-acre Gateway National Recreation Area.</p>
        <p>Interior officials argue that building an 82-foot tower with a 37-foot ball on top would violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the law governing Gateway. Since Interior, through the National Park Service, has given the New York Police Department a long-term lease to use the airfield for its helicopters, its case against the radar is somewhat compromised. Interior ought to press for an accord under which the F.A.A. will remove the radar when improved technology and alternative sites become available.</p>
        <p>New York's airports are among the nation's busiest. Barring the emergence of a technically sound case for another site, air travelers' needs should trump the Interior Department's objections to the short-term use of a small slice of public parkland. The final arbiters of this dispute, the Justice Department and the White House, should settle this matter quickly and err on the side of enhancing air safety.</p>
