        <p>In specialized Islamic cassette shops across this country, a two-hour tape that rails against the Saudi Government has become the latest hit of the subversive Islamic materials making the rounds in Saudi Arabia.</p>

        <p>In specialized Islamic cassette shops across this country, a two-hour tape that rails against the Saudi Government has become the latest hit of the subversive Islamic materials making the rounds in Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>"Royal family princes are not owed allegiance except if they follow the rules of Islam," the unidentified speaker declares, opening the tape's assault on the Saudi rulers. The tape goes on to attack the senior religious leaders allied with the monarchy; the United States, which is described as an atheist enemy of Islam, and most of all the growing number of middle- and upper-class Saudis who have turned away from religion and toward a secular, Western-oriented way of life. 'The Supergun' Is the Title</p>
        <p>The recorded message, called "The Supergun," is perhaps the sharpest illustration of a yearlong confrontation with an increasingly outspoken group of Muslim clergymen who have challenged the ruling establishment of Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>This confrontation is of great importance to the future of a kingdom that sits on the world's largest pool of oil, a kingdom that ranks as the West's most prized ally and friend in the Middle East today. But even though the verbal battle is sharp, the consensus here is that the fundamentalists will not win.</p>
        <p>After Saudi Arabia emerged relatively unscathed from the Persian Gulf war, its Government decided that it could best insure continued prosperity by looking outward, modernizing the nation's laws and expanding personal and institutional freedoms. This change from a tradition of conservativism in foreign and domestic policies has brought a backlash from radical clergymen and their young followers.</p>
        <p>The fundamentalists' campaign is actively opposed by many of the secular Saudis, who are continuing to demand more liberalization. In the middle stands the one power that has for 60 years been the arbiter of consensus here -- the House of Saud, which is headed by King Fahd.</p>
        <p>Until a year ago, the Saudi Government largely ignored the religious radicalism, considering it a minor problem. Today it appears to be moving swiftly to contain it by calling on traditional religious leaders to rein in the radicals, and by calling fundamentalist leaders in for questioning and depriving them of their pulpits in mosques.</p>
        <p>But it appears that the House of Saud has decided that its security and the welfare of the nation lie in forging ahead with modernization despite the protests.</p>
        <p>Officials here say the new Consultative Council announced by King Fahd last Sunday will expand public participation in government. The council's 60 members, who will be chosen by the King over the next six months, are expected to be figures from academia, business and the friendly religious elite, not the fundamentalists who are challenging the Government's modernizing trend.</p>
        <p>Ignoring fundamentalist objections, the council is expected to reinforce policies favoring banks and business ventures with Western industries, vastly expanding the margin of operations for a booming private sector.</p>
        <p>"There is no self-doubt here," a senior diplomat said of the Government's policy.</p>
        <p>To oppose it, the fundamentalists have only their invective, but it is not an insignificant weapon when circulated on mass-produced recordings that are distributed free of charge on streetcorners or at nominal cost at the Islamic shops. These are small storefront operations, invariably full of bearded men, that sell inspirational recordings and literature and such trinkets as jigsaw puzzles of the shrines at Mecca. Corruption Is Attacked</p>
        <p>"The Supergun," named after the Iraqi project to build an artillery piece with a range of hundreds of miles, zeroes in on corruption, mismanagement and theft of the public treasury as the main problems of the country.</p>
        <p>"The personal behavior of some of our rulers is so scandalous that it is the subject of books and articles abroad which are damaging our reputation," it says.</p>
        <p>"Look at how senior officials and ministers have stayed in their jobs for decades, as if this nation is devoid of qualified men," the speaker says. "Look at their friendship with atheist nations which they consult in all affairs as their Information Ministry bans any newspaper or magazine that attacks America."</p>
        <p>Another tape, popular for more than two years, is "America As I Saw It," by a well-known preacher named Ayid al-Qorni. The hourlong tape describes the United States as a thoroughly atheistic nation in which men marry other men, where sons and daughters abandon their parents to hunger and old age, where women have fatherless children, where movies "show animals fornicating with humans." 'A Nation of Beasts'</p>
        <p>He complains that exercisers jog in the streets "practically naked like animals" and that women look at men straight in the eye "without shame and without veil to cover them." He says America is in decline because it is a "nation of beasts who fornicate and eat rotten food," adding that he prays to God to destroy the United States "the same way he destroyed Russia."</p>
        <p>Tapes like these are avidly consumed by tens of thousands of militant Muslims. But in the judgment of many Saudis and foreign diplomats, the radical fringe is outnumbered.</p>
        <p>A major reason is that in Saudi Arabia the working class, where anti-establishment sentiment might be expected to take root, is mostly imported from Asia and poor countries of the Middle East. An estimated four million to five million expatriates sweep the streets, pump the oil, drive the cars and build the cities, and they would lose their treasured jobs and visas if they dared to speak out against the authorities.</p>
        <p>Most Saudis -- 8 million to 11 million -- belong to the middle and upper classes, enjoying a level of comfort that does not tend to breed revolutionary fervor. Even Saudi women, who have reason to be angry with a system that severely restricts their access to jobs, education and property ownership and their freedom to travel, are quiescent.</p>
        <p>"Over here conservatives means people who do not want to rock the boat, and that's the great majority of the Saudis," said a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The House of Saud may have termites, but it is not too late to call in exterminators." A Saudi Sea Change</p>
        <p>Saudis and foreign diplomats here say that what underlies this judgment is a sea change that has taken place here over the last 18 months, a product of Saudi Arabia's unprecedented opening to the West after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, and of an oil boom, now in its 19th year, that has finally tipped the balance of Saudi society to people with money, education and a Western orientation.</p>
        <p>Liberal, educated Saudis constitute virtually the entire middle class, but also a substantial number of the estimated 6,000 to 7,000 in the Saudi royal family, and it is these people who have been accommodated by the Government's initiatives since the gulf crisis.</p>
        <p>"What was before the war cannot be after it," said a prince who spoke on condition of anonymity. "These reforms are viewed as a safety valve."</p>
        <p>In foreign policy, the Saudi leaders proudly proclaim their alliance with the West, ignoring the fundamentalists' condemnations of Westerners as the "new Crusaders fighting Islam." The Government has strongly supported the Middle East peace talks, which began in October. Prominent American Jews have publicly visited the country, visits that not long ago would have been unthinkable. Council to Review Laws</p>
        <p>On the domestic front, the new Consultative Council is to serve at the King's pleasure, and bears no resemblance to a Western-style democratic body. But it is supposed to review laws and Government policies and is empowered to recommend that the King reject those that are found lacking. The council will give a powerful new forum to the Westernized, pro-business establishment, which is expected to provide most of its membership.</p>
        <p>The middle-class endorsement of these bold steps can be measured by the boom in the Saudi stock market, the return here of an estimated $20 billion to $30 billion in capital that had fled to the West during the gulf crisis, a record-breaking expansion of investment in the Saudi private sector and brisk business at banks. That has occurred despite constant warnings from fundamentalists against loan interest, which some Islamic authorities say is forbidden by the Koran.</p>
        <p>The new Consultative Council is in part a recognition that many Saudi business executives and administrators have surpassed the pool of royal family princes in prominence in the public and private sectors. It also symbolically makes room for the hundreds of thousands of educated Saudis who, benefiting from the oil bonanza of the last two decades, have emerged from schools to claim a place in society.</p>
        <p>With the end of the princes' monopoly over decision-making, it is clear that the ancient structure of Saudi society, which is based on tribal and paternalistic systems of government and has sustained the country since its founding 60 years ago, is changing.</p>
        <p>"There are so many royal family princes now, something like 7,000 or so, that even within the royal family itself there is a hierarchy and a meritocracy system," a senior Arab diplomat said. "You really have to do something particularly brilliant to be noticed."</p>
        <p>The new Government policies were also influenced by a falling-out with foreign-based fundamentalist movements like the Islamic Salvation Front of Algeria, the Nahda movement in Tunisia and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Sudan, Jordan and Syria. These movements, once thought to be friends of Saudi Arabia, proved during the gulf crisis to be determined enemies, siding with Iraq and calling for the downfall of the Saudi royal family. New Crop of Preachers</p>
        <p>Across the country over the last year and before that, a crop of Muslim preachers in religious universities who are in their 30's and 40's emerged to oppose the recent modernizing trends. These militants, who number in the tens of thousands, are the product of a previous policy by the Government on the idea that more religious education is better. The Government used to seek the support of its own religious establishment to resist Iran's radical clergy and Iraq's secularist revolutionary ideology.</p>
        <p>The result was a vast crop of people whose religious training is unsuited to a dynamic economy that requires knowledge of foreign languages, business administration and technical skills to move forward.</p>
        <p>But the end of the gulf crisis in 1991 and the end of the war between Iraq and Iran in 1988 have diminished the Saudi Government's fear of these two regional powers, making the support of the fundamentalists expendable.</p>
        <p>"The importance of these new laws," commented Turki al-Hamad, a professor of political science in King Saud University in Riyadh, who has often been attacked in speeches by religious militants as a secularist, "lies in the fact that they block the way to any auctioneering and betting over the Islamization of politics and the society." Interviewed in the Saudi daily Asharq Al Awsat, Mr. Hamad said they set "clear Islamic parameters in constitutional terms." Joint Ventures With West</p>
        <p>Given its immense oil reserves and major strides in consumer industries and finance, Government officials say it is now clear that Saudi Arabia's future lies in joint ventures with Western economies, which are multiplying.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the security of Saudi Arabia, as has been amply demonstrated in the gulf crisis, is intimately tied to a commitment by the West to defend it, leaving little choice but to further reinforce ties with the West.</p>
        <p>To reach these goals, the ruling establishment has clearly decided that if it has to take sides in the internal debate, it must side with the liberals whose political agenda is focused on rewriting the social convenent to emphasize greater freedoms and more democratization.</p>
        <p>"The religious establishment is sure that any changes toward the orbit of modernity will be at their expense, which means the lines of battle are drawn," said a top Arab diplomat from the gulf who lives here.</p>
