        <p>A plan by a Canadian land development company for a $320 million project on the site of two historic buildings in Hartford faces an uncertain future as a result of opposition by preservation groups.</p>
        <p>The Pan Pacific Development Corporation of Vancouver, B.C., wants to build what it calls the Hartford Town Center on a decaying section of Main Street. Plans called for the center to include department stores and two 22-story office towers enclosing a shopping mall. An 1876 building known as the Cheney Block, designed by the architect Henry Hobson Richardson, would be demolished, as would the adjoining Sage-Allen Company building, which dates to 1898.</p>
        <p>Within a week of announcing the project, however, George Lawtey, the president of Pan Pacific, changed his proposal and said he would preserve at least part of the facade of the six-story Cheney Block. The Connecticut Historical Commission, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation and other groups have mounted a campaign to keep the two old buildings. And Hartford's City Manager, Alfred A. Gatta, said city agencies would ''ask many questions'' about the project if Pan Pacific filed a preliminary rezoning application, as required by law. Mr. Gatta noted that the issue was further complicated because, while Pan Pacific bought the Sage-Allen building, it only leases the Cheney Block. The city owns the land and building.</p>
