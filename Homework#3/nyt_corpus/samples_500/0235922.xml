        <p>LEAD: Representative Mike Espy of Mississippi says people have to get used to him.</p>
        <p>Representative Mike Espy of Mississippi says people have to get used to him.</p>
        <p>He is a reliable supporter of civil rights, voting rights and sanctions against South Africa, but also backs the death penalty for particularly heinous crimes. He invokes the memory of Fannie Lou Hamer, the Mississippi civil rights leader, but also appears in an advertisement for the National Rifle Associaonon This is real-life politics, bridge-building in the Deep South, the 35-year-old Democrat says. This is representing your district, when your district is half black and half white, receptive to a Democratic economic message but steeped in conservative values, different from that of any other member of the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>
        <p>There are several firsts and onlys attached to Mr. Espy: the first black Congressman from Mississippi since Reconstruction, the only black Congressman from a rural district, and the Representative of the poorest district in the poorest state in the nation. Some Broader Verities</p>
        <p>But there are some broader verities here. Mr. Espy says he does not want to sound parochial, but he sings the anthem of the House of Representatives, where life is rarely ideologically neat and where Thomas P. O'Neill's dictum that all politics is local always rules.</p>
        <p>In 1986, when Mr. Espy first ran in Mississippi's Second Congressional District against Webb Franklin, the Republican incumbent, Mr. Espy won 10 percent of the white vote. In 1988 he won 43 percent.</p>
        <p>''Service, service, service,'' Mr. Espy said in explaining his success. He took pains to work with farmers and became a champion of the catfish industry, a major employer there. There was also some very skillful politicking, a formidable organization to turn out the black vote, careful polling that found his areas of strength among whites in his Mississippi Delta district.</p>
        <p>The Congressman is a serious young man with the earnest likeability of the senior class president that he was. (Back then, there was also a white senior class president at his school.) Mr. Espey, a lawyer, also comes from a notable family; his grandfather built the first black hospital in Mississippi. He knows his own symbolic value. Criticism on N.R.A. Ad</p>
        <p>With his an image in national political circles, Mr. Espy's decision to appear in an N.R.A. ad this year drew considerable notice and criticism outside his district. (Within the district the reaction was positive.) ''I got some letters from friends in New York,'' the Congressman said. ''They were disappointed. I got some complimentary letters, but most of the letters I got from the East Coast were letters of criticism.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Espy notes that he agreed to appear in the advertisement before a gunman armed with a semiautomatic assault rifle killed five children in a schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., in January. The slayings ignited a raging debate over such weapons. Mr. Espy says he does not agree with the rifle association on every issue, and would support a carefully defined ban on semiautomatic weapons.</p>
        <p>''That organization, at least in this part of the country, is one that's highly regarded,'' Mr. Espy said of the association. ''I've been a member since 1974.'' He added: ''Look at me in the context of my record. My record is based on 600-some votes from my first term.'' Conservative Issues Stressed</p>
        <p>He talked one recent afternoon of the importance of issues like gun control and school prayer in the South, of conservative attitudes among blacks and whites alike. It is a lesson that Democrats outside the region need to recognize, he said.</p>
        <p>''You've first got to be invited past the door,'' the Congressman asserted. ''And we don't get invited past the door because of these visceral issues - gun control, flag, patriotism. They don't want to hear your ideas on the economy and foreign affairs and on defense because they don't like you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Espy recently gave a short course on his brand of politics, driving in the late afternoon to the town of Flora, Miss. On the way into town he passed a trap and skeet range, and then, on the edge of town, he happened across a woman he wanted a reporter to meet. The woman, who was 87 years old, was walking slowly up the road, leaning heavily on a stick. She had lived in a utility shed in a junk yard until recently; before that, she had lived between two refrigerators. Mr. Espy had gotten her a trailer.</p>
        <p>''Do you remember me?'' he asked her. ''How are you getting on?'' The Congressman in the N.R.A. ad was the Congressman asking after the woman.</p>
