        <p>LEAD: Under mandate of the Legislature, legal scholars here are polishing a new state law that they detest and believe to be unconstitutional. Their task is to mesh the new law with the complex state civil code.</p>
        <p>Under mandate of the Legislature, legal scholars here are polishing a new state law that they detest and believe to be unconstitutional. Their task is to mesh the new law with the complex state civil code.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless the scholars believe the new law, scheduled to take effect on July 1, 1990, will tear at family ties, add fuel to the fire in family disputes and create the potential of costly intrafamily litigation.</p>
        <p>The law, which was passed last summer amid an acid debate that has not abated, permits parents to disinherit adult children for no reason. It also for the first time allows disinherited children to contest a will on the ground that the favored beneficiary had undue influence with the parent.</p>
        <p>The new law's best-known champion is Chalin Perez Sr., the wealthy son of the Leander Perez, known as the dictator of Plaquemines Parish as late as the 1960's, who ran the isolated oil-rich region about 10 miles south of New Orleans like a feudal fiefdom. His son has been engaged in two generations of family feuds over power as well as inheritance. Skilled Lobbyist Enlisted</p>
        <p>Mr. Perez hired a skilled lobbyist to promote the new law, and both were propelling forces in the Capitol as the bill inched its way through the Legislature with little public attention.</p>
        <p>''Greed, prejudice, jealousy, meanness and fear will henceforth have a much freer hand in influencing a parent's testamentary plans,'' said Cynthia Samuel, a Tulane law professor and one who is polishing the law.</p>
        <p>The new law is a revision of a statute that lies at the heart of Louisiana's Napoleonic Code, the system of civil law in use here since 1825. The code has been under revision for years to modernize it.</p>
        <p>The original statute stipulated that parents must leave a portion of their wealth to their progeny, one-fourth if there is one child and one-half if there are two or more children. Its proponents argue that this ''forced heirship'' law, along with the state's community property law, made Louisiana the fairest of all the states in the way family wealth was handed down from one generation to the next.</p>
        <p>Under community property law, which is unchanged, family riches belong equally to husband and wife so that a spouse is free to distribute only one-half of the combined assets to his or her heirs. Proponents Claim Flexibility</p>
        <p>In defense of the changes, proponents say the new law will give Louisianans more flexibility in how they choose to dispose of their estates. In the revision, the Legislature limited the forced heirship law to apply only to children under the age of 23 and to handicapped adult children.</p>
        <p>Academicians and other legal experts believe the change has virtually destroyed the forced heirship concept, but feel the revision may not survive an attack on its constitutionality because it has introduced an age distinction.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, under directive of the Legislature, members of the Louisiana State Law Institute, which includes lawyers, judges and academicians, are polishing the legislation's language. Many people who opposed the change continue to debate it, and some have indicated they will lobby for its repeal.</p>
        <p>For years disgruntled parents have tried to abolish the law, but none as wealthy and canny as Mr. Perez, who learned the intricacies of Louisiana politics at the knee of his father, a master strategist who helped lead the fight against civil rights in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's.</p>
        <p>The bill's sponsor, State Senator Sydney Nelson, whose northern district borders East Texas and includes Shreveport, had tried for a decade to abolish the law. But this year he gained a strong ally in Mr. Perez and changed strategy. Rather than seeking outright abolition, Mr. Nelson proposed changing the law to exclude adult children.</p>
        <p>Chalin Perez hired a prominent Louisiana lobbyist, E. L. (Bubba) Henry, former Speaker of the State House, who shepherded the bill to its final passage. 'He Knew How to Go After It'</p>
        <p>''Chalin is very bright and capable and when he wanted to get something done, he knew how to go after it,'' said State Representative Jim Donelon, a suburban lawyer who opposed the bill. Lobbyists ''like Bubba Henry,'' Mr. Donelon said, are usually employed ''by major corporations, by well-heeled types and not by mom-and-pop types.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Donelon said others favoring the bill included ''three dozen testators, each involved in some down-and-dirty family fight.'' Advocates also included The Shreveport Times, but the bill was barely noticed by many other newspapers until after it was enacted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donelon said he fought the bill because ''we have a system that has worked well for hundreds of years.'' He added, ''I am a card-carrying Republican who respects private property, but I'm also aware of the effectiveness of forced heirship in keeping litigation down as opposed to the other 49 states, which do not have this ancient law.''</p>
        <p>Professor Samuel of Tulane and other law professors who fought the change, testifying before legislative committees, say much of the world outside the United States has kept similar forced heirship laws.</p>
        <p>''This is an old legal institution that serves a new social purpose, guaranteeing that kids don't get divorced from their inheritance when their parents get divorced from each other,'' she said. ''Sometimes what's old has the wisdom of the ages.'' New Role Seen for Old Law</p>
        <p>By the early 1900's, Louisiana's forced heirship law had become ''a little old-fashioned,'' said Mary Ann Glendon, a professor at Harvard Law School, but now ''with about 50 percent of all marriages ending in divorce, it has become modern again because of the changed circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Professor Glendon said that when a spouse remarries in other states, the children of the first marriage ''are apt not to see property that was accumulated during that marriage,'' adding, ''Louisiana enabled an older person to say to the second spouse 'the law requires me to leave a portion of my estate to my children.' ''</p>
        <p>At a recent forum on the new law, Frederick Swaim, a professor at Loyola University's Law School here, said, ''We're going to have this thing litigated for centuries.''</p>
        <p>Another believer in the old law, Janice Barry, who left her job as staff lawyer in the State Attorney General's Office to raise a family, worked as an unpaid lobbyist against the bill. Mrs. Barry says she is prepared to lobby again for its repeal.</p>
        <p>She recalled a brisk exchange with a legislator, who told her, ''This is my money, I made it and I can do what I want with it.</p>
        <p>''I told him,'' Mrs. Barry said, '' 'They're your children and you made them too and they have a claim.' ''  THE LAW</p>
