        <p>A day after a bone-crushing brawl between rival retinues and angry fans who began landing blows once the professional fighters had been stopped, Madison Square Garden officials said yesterday that they would continue staging boxing matches.</p>
        <p>The fray followed a prizefight between Riddick Bowe and Andrew Golota.

        <p>A day after a bone-crushing brawl between rival retinues and angry fans who began landing blows once the professional fighters had been stopped, Madison Square Garden officials said yesterday that they would continue staging boxing matches.</p>
        <p>The fray followed a prizefight between Riddick Bowe and Andrew Golota. It raised questions about whether the Garden -- where boxing legends like Muhammad  Ali, Joe Frazier, Sugar Ray Robinson and Jake LaMotta fought their way to fame -- had warned the police of the potential for violence among fans. Authorities also wondered whether the police, who subdued the brawl after a 911 call from a  man watching it on cable television at home in Brooklyn, had mobilized fast enough.</p>
        <p>This was not handled as well as I'd like to see this handled," Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, said.</p>
        <p>But he added that the Garden -- which got back into the fight business last year after staging matches only sporadically in the 1980's and not at all since  1993 -- would go ahead with the next scheduled one, on Aug. 13. Boxing has proved a big moneymaker for owners worried that the Garden has been dark too often.</p>
        <p>Eleven people were arrested yesterday in connection with the incident, which  sent a dozen people to the hospital with minor injuries. The police say they expect to make more arrests.</p>
        <p>The fray began when the referee gave Thursday night's heavyweight bout to Mr. Bowe, the 252-pound former champion, disqualifying Mr. Golota for landing low blows. Mr. Bowe's manager, Rock Newman, jumped into the ring, where the fighter  was lying on the canvas.</p>
        <p>Soon, someone was pounding Mr. Golota's head with a walkie-talkie. And fans waving Polish flags, who had come to root for the Warsaw-born Mr. Golota, were climbing into the ring.</p>
        <p>The battle continued for several minutes before the two sides were subdued. Most of Mr. Bowe's fans were black and most of Mr. Golota's white, but the police said they did not believe that racial antagonism had precipitated the fighting.</p>
        <p>The police said yesterday that they had filed charges against three men in Mr. Bowe's camp. Police Commissioner Howard Safir identified the man who had hit Mr. Golota on the head with the walkie-talkie as Jason Harris, a member of Mr. Bowe's entourage. Mr. Harris gave himself up last night, the police said. He was charged with assault and, for wielding the radio, criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree.</p>
        <p>Detectives from the Midtown South precinct arrested at least two other members of Mr. Bowe's entourage yesterday. Stephen Bowe, 23, whom the police identified as Mr.  Bowe's brother, was charged with assault for throwing punches in the ring. William Wright, 31, was also arrested, and charged with assault and inciting to riot. Mr. Safir said Mr. Wright was "part of the Bowe group."</p>
        <p>As of last night eight other people had been arrested in connection with the  brawl. The police identified them as: Joe Gregory, 29; Yohance Maqubela, 22; Gkzegorz Glowack, 20; Darius Konefal, 28; Andrew Holyaski, 20; Andrzes Walat, 20; Melvin Foster, 43, and Steven Wright, 16.</p>
        <p>The police said they had learned of the fight about 10:45, when spectators scurrying out of the Garden told some of the 16 officers on crowd-control duty outside that fans were fighting. That was roughly six minutes after the seventh-round disqualification and six minutes after the chairs, beer cans and punches started flying.</p>
        <p>Police supervisors ordered the officers at the Garden to report to 32d Street and Seventh Avenue, where they gathered in a wedge-shaped formation, ready to move in and restore order, Mr. Safir said. "We were there in seconds," he added.</p>
        <p>But they did not go in immediately because, under a protocol revised after a  stampede at a City College basketball game several years ago, the police are supposed to wait for a security liaison from inside the building to invite them  in.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the invitation never came.</p>
        <p>One person in the crowd who tried to summon help was Randy Levine, the city's former Labor Commissioner and now the chief negotiator for Major League Baseball. Mr. Levine said he had called the police desk at City Hall within four minutes of the disqualification.</p>
        <p>Then he called the Mayor, who was doing an interview at WPIX-TV. He said Mr.  Giuliani already knew about the tumult. The Mayor soon left the station and went to the Garden, where he was ushered into one of the dressing rooms under heavy guard.</p>
        <p>At 10:48, the 911 system received its first call about the melee, from a man  on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn who said he was watching it on HBO, the cable network that had broadcast the bout. "About 100 people are fighting in the ring," the man said.</p>
        <p>A minute later, 911 sent out a call for a mobilization and assigned all officers in the Midtown South sector to respond to the Garden. At the same time, a call of "officer in need of assistance" went out over the police radio, and the police went in.</p>
        <p>Between 2,000 and 3,000 fans were still inside. The police report on the incident revealed that besides the pummeling going on in the ring, there were "several groups of fighting males in the crowd." Officers cordoned off the apron surrounding the ring and began breaking up the brawls. A total of 150 officers were on hand by 11:08, when the police declared the situation under control.</p>
        <p>Reviewing the incident yesterday, the Mayor said that Madison Square Garden should have notified the Police Department of the potential for violence in a crowd that was younger and more aggressive than the Knicks, Rangers or Ice Capades crowds that often fill the same seats.</p>
        <p>"You can't expect the Police Department to be omnipresent and able to predict every single thing that would happen," the Mayor said. "They have to rely on the sports organization to come to them to ask for additional help."</p>
        <p>The Mayor said that he had already talked with Garden officials about changing the policy to increase the police presence at sporting events.</p>
        <p>"From now on," he said, "we have to have more access, we have to have, the police have, the right to and the opportunity to be inside these arenas, not at  the request of anyone."</p>
        <p>Some spectators said the wait for the police had seemed frighteningly long.</p>
        <p>"If indeed the police were there when they say," said Anthony D. Weiner, a City Councilman from Brooklyn, "they were nowhere near the action." Mr. Weiner,  who was attending his first prizefight and was accompanied by his father, added:</p>
        <p>"We waited, I'd say, a good 10 to 12 minutes, expecting the police to swoop down and stop this thing. The announcer said, more than once, 'If there are any  New York City police officers, come to ringside.' First, it was security personnel to ringside. Then, at least twice, he said, 'New York City police officers report to ringside.' "</p>
        <p>A Garden vice president, John Cirillo, defended the Garden's 70 security officers and 50 ushers. "They were prepared and they acted accordingly," he said. "It was an unfortunate situation. We are going to make sure we take every  precaution to do a better job in the future."</p>
        <p>He said that Garden officials would meet with the Mayor and Mr. Safir next week "to discuss making the Garden as safe a facility as we can."</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 15, 1996, Monday</p>
        <p>A front-page article on Saturday about a brawl after a boxing match at Madison Square Garden Thursday night referred incorrectly to Stephen Bowe, one of the men arrested. He is a nephew of the boxer Riddick Bowe, not his brother.  He attended the bout as a spectator, not as a member of the boxer's ring entourage.</p>
