        <p>LEAD: High and huge on its granite base here stands the last Soviet statue of Josef Stalin. Like the songs Gori children sing about him - ''Little Gori is great: It gave birth to Stalin'' - the statue is a tribute to the visceral loyalty he still commands in his native town.</p>
        <p>High and huge on its granite base here stands the last Soviet statue of Josef Stalin. Like the songs Gori children sing about him - ''Little Gori is great: It gave birth to Stalin'' - the statue is a tribute to the visceral loyalty he still commands in his native town.</p>
        <p>The statue's endurance, however, is a tribute to something else: the grudging tolerance of Communist Party officials still grappling with a new era of political pluralism.</p>
        <p>For when rumors swept the town two years ago that Communist Party authorities had ordered the 40-foot statue removed, dozens of residents in this textile-producing town of 60,000 surrounded the monument in a loose, protective cordon. A Vigil of Three Days</p>
        <p>''For three nights and three days we sat there,'' said Maya Takalova, 45 years old, a Gori resident. The citizens did not leave until a local party official denied the rumors, said Mrs. Takalova and a friend who also took part in the demonstration.</p>
        <p>Things were different 30 years earlier when a group of students in the Georgian Republic's capital, Tbilisi, demonstrated to protect another statue of Stalin during another period of destalinization. That time, the protesters were met with soldiers and guns.</p>
        <p>The graves of two teen-agers who died in the gunfire that ended the demonstration on March 9, 1956, are carefully tended by a cemetery groundsman in Tbilisi, who said: ''Wait 100 years. There will still never be another man like him on our whole globe.'' Memory's Strong Grip</p>
        <p>Despite two years of increasingly sharp press criticism of Stalin, encouraged by the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, memory of the dead leader's iron control has a stronger grip on many Georgian spirits than the living leader's logic.</p>
        <p>Asked whether she would prefer Mr. Gorbachev or Stalin as the leader of her country, Mrs. Takalova said, ''Stalin, of course.''</p>
        <p>Stalin's picture appears but once or twice in the newly issued photo books about World War II sold in Georgian bookstores, but bootleg copies of his photograph, in full military ragalia, can be obtained on the streets for the asking.</p>
        <p>''There was justice,'' said Iliyo Palelashvili, a 77-year-old Gori resident who served as a rank and file soldier during the war. ''There were real laws back in Stalin's time. If we hadn't had those laws, we wouldn't have won the war.''</p>
        <p>But his adulation is not shared by most of the republic's intellectual elite, whose predecessors were virtually wiped out in Stalin's purges.</p>
        <p>Here, where feuds are sharp, the purges settled not only the political but also the personal scores of Stalin and his fellow Georgian, the secret police commander Lavrenti T. Beria. A Collection of Tributes</p>
        <p>''It's just the older generation who still revere him,'' said Elizbar Dzhavelidze, editor of the Georgian-language weekly Literary Georgia, which carries a regular feature highlighting the fate of Stalin's victims.</p>
        <p>In late 1986, the first powerful statement of the anti-Stalinist sentiment that would soon dominate Soviet culture was the film ''Repentance,'' by the Georgian director Tengiz Abuladze, which was released after two years of censorship.</p>
        <p>But paradoxically, it is the policies of Mr. Gorbachev - a leader bent on freeing the Soviet system from the political, psychological and economic straitjackets of Stalinism - that have given Stalinists in Georgia a little room to breathe.</p>
        <p>While printed praise of Stalin is rare even here, it is not unknown. Criticism, another Georgian-language newspaper, printed a collection of tributes to Stalin last month.</p>
        <p>Private symbols of reverence, from oil portraits to gear shift knobs made from busts of Stalin, are easy to spot. A Temple to Stalin</p>
        <p>Private expression, however, is one thing. Public expression - especially in the form of the Stalin Museum in Gori - is another.</p>
        <p>Heavy with columned solemnity, the museum sits like a temple at the end of a pretty greensward along Stalin Avenue. Next to it sits Stalin's personal train car, and in front of that, under an extravagant roof supported by columns, sits the two-room house in which he was born 109 years ago.</p>
        <p>The museum, whose closing was announced last summer but not put into effect until two weeks ago, is redoing its exhibits. Down the road, the town's military museum remains open, exhibiting one larger-than-life plaster statue of Stalin, a bas-relief, and two smaller statuettes.</p>
        <p>''Any small city like ours would be proud that a man had been born there who left some footprint on history,'' said Malkhaz Gochashvili, 34, as he sat in his office at the Gori city Communist Party headquarters. But Mr. Gochashvili, who heads the organizational division of the city party, was circumspect when it came to his own opinions of his town's most famous native son.</p>
        <p>''I am a Communist,'' he said. ''I follow the party line.''</p>
        <p>The ever-shifting character of that line was evident in some historical works on his shelf, including a tabloid compilation of official announcements and tributes printed at Stalin's death.</p>
        <p>Inside a cover with a full-page picture of Stalin, it said, ''Stalin's immortal name will live forever in the hearts of the Soviet people and of all progressive mankind.'' 'Stalin Is Our Neighbor'</p>
        <p>Forever, perhaps, but in what context?</p>
        <p>Although the continuing re-examination of Soviet history has forced Soviet schools to cancel history exams until new texts can be published, students in Gori still use the old texts, which praise Stalin's role as a military leader.</p>
        <p>''We studied with the old books,'' said Georgi Kotolashvili, 18, as he stood with two friends near the Stalin Museum in Gori.</p>
        <p>Georgi Tedeluri, also 18, said ''we don't agree'' with the current criticism of Stalin, adding: ''We live here, near the museum. We like to say that Stalin is our neighbor. We love him.''</p>
        <p>Lea Savinidze, a Gori housewife who has raised five children to respect the leader they never knew, said: ''We can speak freely. General Stalin is like a god to us.''</p>
        <p>''We all in this town have his picture in the center of our homes,'' she said. ''On Dec. 21, Stalin's birthday, we drink toasts to him as if he were alive.''</p>
