        <p>LEAD: AFTER an overland trek through America's regional theaters, Eric Overmyer's ''On the Verge or the Geography of Yearning'' has arrived in New York with its wit and imagination intact.

        <p>AFTER an overland trek through America's regional theaters, Eric Overmyer's ''On the Verge or the Geography of Yearning'' has arrived in New York with its wit and imagination intact. The play opened last night at the John Houseman Theater in a production ingeniously outfitted by the director Garland Wright, and by members of the Acting Company.</p>
        <p>During the play's visits to various other ports of call - I saw two different prior productions, at Center Stage in Baltimore and at the Hartford Stage Company - the author used his machete to thwack away at the thicket of puns and imagery. As a result, the play has become pithier, but more pruning would have been advisable; each of the two acts remains attenuated.</p>
        <p>However, the surfeit does not deter us from appreciating the journey, as Mr. Overmyer sends three prototypical Victorian women explorers touring through time, space and metaphor. In common with S. J. Perelman and Tom Stoppard, the author has a connoisseur's love of language. In addition, he is enamored of his explorers, heroines who leave the comfort of cities like Terre Haute in order to sojourn to a Terra that becomes increasingly Incognita.</p>
        <p>The show begins neatly enough as the three (Lisa Banes, Patricia Hodges and Laura Hicks) gird themselves for their expedition. They are equipped for all Arctic-tropic emergencies. Even as they are buffeted by surprises, they remain surefooted and quick-minded. These are, stalwartly, pre-feminist representatives of the stronger sex.</p>
        <p>They tell us tall tales of past exploits - teaching headhunters to play croquet, watching the Dalai Lama transform gold coins into yak butter. To a great extent, the palaver is the action, although periodically the women wander astray and meet strangers, all species played by Tom Robbins. Gradually, one realizes that there is something sub-terra afoot, a dislocation with the dimension of a time warp.</p>
        <p>The explorers receive psychic messages from the future. Strange words like ''Cool Whip'' enter their perception and unknown artifacts are discovered on the landscape. Confronted with an egg beater, they regard it quizzically and then conclude it must be a talisman. Merrily, the playwright forges ahead from fanciful reinterpretation of history to contemporary cultural commentary.</p>
        <p>Like Mark Twain's Eve, the explorers see the world - and say the words - as if for the first time. Questioning such self-made contradictions as ''guest hosts,'' they begin to dabble in semiotics. At least in part, the play is about the debasement of language. As one of the women says, ''I have seen the future and it is slang.''</p>
        <p>Eventually the time travelers reach the 1950's. A palanquin pulls up at an Esso station and a Dragon Lady emerges, soon followed by other odd figures. Faced with the apotheosis of 1955, only one of the three heroines continues the chronokinetic excursion, marching onward to the future, which is, of course, our present.</p>
        <p>Because of the vertiginous verbiage, the play is an Everest for actresses. Memorization itself is a tongue-tripping feat. The Acting Company trio performs with the agility of a team of high-wire walkers while also demonstrating an evident zest for the material.</p>
        <p>During the play's two-year passage to New York, the author has sharpened the individuality of his characters. Ms. Banes is playing the most insurgent of the three - a born pioneer. Ms. Hodges, the most traditional, has a fondness for hearth and husband (he appears in a dream sequence). Ms. Hicks, a photojournalist in the making, is a montage of modernism. While the actresses seek singular definition, Mr. Robbins is a self-diffuser. Chameleon-like, he shifts from cannibal to Actors Studio-trained troll to an Adorable Snowman.</p>
        <p>More than his directorial predecessors in Baltimore and Hartford, Mr. Wright has successfully moved the script away from literalization. This is the most intimate and also the most eye-catching of the three productions, and it is augmented by John Arnone's clean geometric set design. Mr. Arnone uses neon-like bars of light to denote everything from rope bridges to jungles, converting the stage into a Mondrian-like environment of perpendiculars. James F. Ingalls's lighting adds its own signal pleasure, with a shift of tone simulating both glacier and desert, and Ann Hould-Ward's costumes are like the best of Banana Republic. The staging and the performances reduce the play's whimsy quotient.</p>
        <p>''On the Verge'' is, by intention, a highly speculative and specialized venture, but for the linguistically inclined, this ardently alliterative and omnivorously onomatopoetic safari should be difficult to resist.</p>
