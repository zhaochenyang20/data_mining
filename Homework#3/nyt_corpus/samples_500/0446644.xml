        <p>Former Yankee Andy Hawkins pitched five and one-third shutout innings in his Oakland debut and Dave Henderson hit his major league-leading 11th home run as the Athletics beat the Cleveland Indians, 3-0, today.</p>
        <p>Hawkins (1-2) was released by the Yankees on May 9 after he went 0-2 with a 9.95 earned run average in four appearances. He agreed to terms with Oakland five days later and was added to their roster before Saturday's game.</p>
        <p>The timing was perfect, because Hawkins has never lost or allowed an earned run at Cleveland Stadium.</p>
        <p>In four career starts covering 31 innings in Cleveland, he is 4-0, including a three-hit shutout last year.</p>
        <p>Hawkins gave up three hits, walked one and struck out two before leaving with one out in the sixth. The Indians got only one runner past first base against him, when Mike Huff walked and stole second in the first inning.</p>
        <p>Joe Klink, the A's fourth pitcher, worked one and one-third scoreless innings and Dennis Eckersley finished the combined four-hitter.</p>
        <p>Charles Nagy (1-3) took the loss, victimized by an error and lack of support.</p>
        <p>Angels 4, Orioles 2</p>
        <p>BALTIMORE (AP) -- Wally Joyner homered and drove in four runs, including a tiebreaking single in the ninth inning that led California over Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Joyner went 3 for 4, raising his major league-leading average to .391. He is 27 for 55 (.491) in his last 14 games. His two-out, two-out single in the ninth made Chuck Finley (7-1) the winner. Royals 7, Brewers 4</p>
        <p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jim Eisenreich, Danny Tartabull and Carmelo Martinez hit bases-emply homers off reliever Mark Lee in the eighth inning, lifting Kansas City to a victory over Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>The Royals tied it, 3-3, on Brian McRae's two-run homer in the seventh, before the Brewers took a 4-3 lead in the eighth.</p>
        <p>Lee (0-2) relieved Don August to start the eighth and Eisenreich hit the third pitch over the right-field fence. Tartabull followed with a towering drive over the center-field wall and Martinez connected one out later. Twins 4, Tigers 1</p>
        <p>DETROIT (AP) -- Shane Mack and Kirby Puckett each hit home runs as Minnesota sent Detroit to its eighth straight loss.</p>
        <p>The eight-game skid is the longest for the Tigers since they lost 12 straight in 1989.</p>
        <p>Mark Guthrie (3-2) gave up one run and five hits in six innings for the win. Rick Aguilera, who worked two innings for his seventh save, loaded the bases on three walks in the ninth, before Alan Trammell hit a fly ball to end the game. Blue Jays 9, White Sox 2</p>
        <p>CHICAGO (AP) -- Rookie Ed Sprague hit his first major league homer and Jimmy Key pitched four-hit ball for seven innings as Toronto beat Chicago.</p>
        <p>Key (6-2) struck out seven and walked one in improving to 14-5 lifetime against Chicago. Tom Henke, activated from the disabled list Friday, made his first appearance since April 10 and pitched a hitless ninth, striking out one. Expos 3, Giants 1</p>
        <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Tim Burke recorded his 100th career save in relief of a strong effort by Dennis Oil Can Boyd as Montreal beat San Francisco. The Giants (12-24), who are currently last in the National League West, have lost 14 of their last 18 games.</p>
        <p>Boyd (2-4) blanked the Giants on two singles through seven innings and was lifted when Robby Thompson opened the eighth with a double.</p>
        <p>Burke retired the first two batters before pinch-hitter Kevin Mitchell was safe on third baseman Tim Wallach's throwing error, enabling Thompson to score from third.</p>
        <p>Burke pitched a scoreless ninth for his fourth save of the season to finish the combined three-hitter. Phillies 5, Cubs 2</p>
        <p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- John Kruk hit a two-run double and Ricky Jordan followed with a two-run single in the eighth inning to rally Philadelphia past Chicago.</p>
        <p>Joe Boever (3-3) pitched one and two-thirds innings and Mitch Williams got his eighth save as Philadelphia won for the fifth time in six games. Phillies starter Danny Cox left with a groin injury after retiring the first two batters in the sixth. Padres 5, Reds 2</p>
        <p>CINCINNATI (AP) -- Adam Peterson pitched six strong innings for his first National League victory and San Diego ended a three-game losing streak by beating Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>Paul Faries, Fred McGriff and Tony Gwynn had run-scoring singles and Benito Santiago and Bip Roberts had sacrifice flies as the Padres rocked Jack Armstrong (3-2) for only their second victory in 10 games. Tony Fernandez added four hits and scored a run. Cardinals 12, Astros 2</p>
        <p>ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Bryn Smith pitched a three-hitter and added a two-run single as St. Louis got a season-high 18 hits in beating Houston.</p>
        <p>Pedro Guerrero and Todd Zeile each homered. Guerrero connected in the fourth, when the Cardinals scored six runs, helped by three errors.  BASEBALL</p>
