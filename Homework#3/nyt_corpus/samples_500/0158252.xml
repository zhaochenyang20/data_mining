        <p>LEAD: Construction spending advanced 1.1 percent in May as strength in office and factory construction offset weakness in other areas.</p>
        <p>Construction spending advanced 1.1 percent in May as strength in office and factory construction offset weakness in other areas.</p>
        <p>The Commerce Department said today that building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $407.1 billion in May after a dip of two-tenths of 1 percent in April.</p>
        <p>The May gain, the strongest since a 2.8 percent rise in March, came entirely from increases in nonresidential construction, which rose 4.3 percent, to an annual rate of $98.9 billion.</p>
        <p>The increase was led by a 7.8 percent advance in office construction, which pushed this category up by 11 percent over May 1987, and a 7.7 percent advance in factory construction, where activity was 22.8 percent higher than a year ago. Office Sector Strong</p>
        <p>Analysts said the rise in office construction, after a sustained period of weakness, reflected strong activity in the Northeast and some other sections of the country and a halt to the severe decline in building in the Southwest, which has been suffering economically from lower oil prices.</p>
        <p>''Cities such as Chicago, New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., are enjoying good economic growth and a fair amount of office construction,'' said Richard Peach, senior economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''This is happening while the sharp declines in other areas have at least bottomed out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peach said the big jump in factory construction reflected the capital spending boom as manufacturers rush to expand capacity to meet sharply higher export demand for American-made goods. Residential Building Weakens</p>
        <p>Residential construction fell 1 percent during May, to an annual rate of $193.4 billion, reflecting a 1.3 percent drop in construction of single-family homes, which offset a 2.4 percent rise in the smaller apartment sector. Analysts do not expect much strength in this area during the year, particularly because of high vacancy rates for apartments and the loss of tax advantages for investing in residential real estate.</p>
        <p>Government construction projects edged down three-tenths of 1 percent in May, to an annual rate of $78.9 billion. Highway construction, the biggest segment in the government sector, posted a 7.4 percent decline.</p>
        <p>The various changes left overall construction spending 2.3 percent higher than it was a year ago.</p>
