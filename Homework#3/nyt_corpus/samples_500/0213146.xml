        <p>LEAD: Schools spent $3,555 extra for each of the 4.4 million handicapped children receiving some form of special education in the 1985-86 academic year, according to a study prepared for the Government.</p>
        <p>Schools spent $3,555 extra for each of the 4.4 million handicapped children receiving some form of special education in the 1985-86 academic year, according to a study prepared for the Government.</p>
        <p>The total cost for special education students was $6,335 on average, or 2.3 times the $2,780 cost for regular classwork, the report said. About 11 percent of the nation's schoolchildren get some kind of special education.</p>
        <p>The new $1.8 million study, done by a private research company, Decision Resources Corporation, breaks down the special education costs by the different approaches used to teach children with handicaps that range from physical disabilities to mental disorders. The study examined ''resource programs,'' or those serving pupils for less than half of the regular 30-hour school week, and ''self-contained programs,'' those which occupied more than 15 hours a week.</p>
        <p>Looking only at what was spent on special education, the resource programs spent $2,463 per pupil versus $5,566 per pupil in the self-contained programs. But the study said the schools also had regular education costs for these pupils - the full regular cost of $2,780 for those in resource programs, and about half as much, $1,347, for those in self-contained programs. That increased the total per pupil costs to $5,243 for those in resource programs and to $6,913 for those in self-contained programs.</p>
