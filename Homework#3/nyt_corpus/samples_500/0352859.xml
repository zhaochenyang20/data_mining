        <p>LEAD: In March 1936 the photographer Walker Evans, who was documenting poverty in the South, found himself in Beaufort, S.C., facing an undeniably beautiful 18th-century frame house. The delicate carving around the door frame, the detailed corner moldings and elaborate cornices recalled an era of high style and craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>In March 1936 the photographer Walker Evans, who was documenting poverty in the South, found himself in Beaufort, S.C., facing an undeniably beautiful 18th-century frame house. The delicate carving around the door frame, the detailed corner moldings and elaborate cornices recalled an era of high style and craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>But this day, its columned, two-story portico was worn bare of paint and patched with handmade signs advertising the businesses inside.</p>
        <p>There was an art school, a fish market, a fruit and vegetable stand and a stenographer. Some faded lettering suggested former tenants. A sign declared, ''General Lafayette spoke from this porch 1824'' (actually, he spoke in 1825). Below it hung a bundle of spotted bananas.</p>
        <p>The picture Evans took in Beaufort that day, which is in the Library of Congress collections, showed a little town making do in a setting where the once-bright life of the Old South seemed all but snuffed out. Beaufort's past, tattered though it appeared, looked more substantial than its future.</p>
        <p>Today the biggest sign on that house proclaims its name - the John Mark Verdier House - and its listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The paint doesn't dare peel. The commercial life has spread up and down Bay Street and along a half-dozen lateral streets. Colorful awnings shade the sidewalk, and wooden barrels planted with pansies, ivy and impatiens stand along the curbs.</p>
        <p>Prosperity has come to Beaufort and has liberated it from just making do. Gone is the store that sold cigarettes for a nickel apiece; unheard of the old way of repainting the house - one side every couple of years. The ingenious economies of the cash-poor town have all but disappeared. They are not to be found in the groomed yards of the historic district, in the glossy bed-and-breakfast lodgings, in the modish boutiques or restaurants on the river.</p>
        <p>But if prosperity has forced these habits out of service it has also memorialized them. Today Beaufort's ''poor but proud'' years, which lasted here and all over the South from Reconstruction to the end of World War II, have a place in its history, just as the antebellum years have theirs. Poverty, it turns out, was just another phase in the history of this small town.</p>
        <p>Beaufort has been a small town for a long time. Spanish explorers came to the area 100 years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock. French, Scottish and English settlers followed, and by the time of the Revolution, Beaufort was a center of the scattered plantation world where slaves harvested rice, indigo and corn. By century's end, the newly invented cotton gin, the successful cultivation of long-staple cotton on the sea islands, and a growing slave population, contrived to launch Beaufort into its heyday - a 60-year spree of building, buying, expanding and high living that ran until about lunchtime on Nov. 7, 1861, when Union soldiers demolished the Confederate port defenses.</p>
        <p>It is the legacy of these years, the architectural accomplishments they produced and the disastrous decline they precipitated, that impresses every visitor to Beaufort. As in Charleston, the buildings, the old houses and churches stand as they did, now restored, lived in, once again playing a central role in community life. And as common as morning dew is the small-town Southerner's pride in and preoccupation with history, with explaining Southern ways. In Beaufort, there's a story for every piazza - and probably someone nearby to tell it. The past not only informs the present, it seems to populate it.</p>
        <p>If you want a thoughtful introduction to Beaufort's history, or to examine the roots of its style, the Historic Beaufort Foundation operates two house museums: the John Mark Verdier House (801 Bay Street) and the George Parsons Elliott House (1001 Bay Street). The Verdier House - the house Walker Evans photographed - was fully restored in 1976, to represent the apogee of Beaufort style. The Elliott House (circa 1844) is partially restored. The Arsenal Museum (713 Craven Street) housed in the pre-Civil War Gothic-style military building, offers an informal, eclectic view of life in old Beaufort by means of household objects, clothing, documents, natural history specimens and prehistoric Indian artifacts.</p>
        <p>Downtown Beaufort is snugly clustered along the river, now a section of the Intracoastal Waterway, and it appears from a distance much as it did when plantation bateaux, cotton barges and steam-driven packets berthed at its wharves. A few miles distant the river enters Port Royal Sound, considered by navigators since the days of Christopher Columbus to be one of the most accommodating harbors on the southern coast. From the Bay Street bluff to the Atlantic Ocean lie hundreds of acres of unpolluted marsh and tidal estuaries, habitats for dozens of species of birds, fish and shellfish.</p>
        <p>This proximity to the water, or as they say in Beaufort, to the ''weather,'' gave rise to a predominant style of architecture that had its roots in the plantation houses of Barbados. Many houses are set high on foundations made of brick or tabby, a mixture of sand, oyster shells and lime prepared by slaves. Some of these raised basements are arcaded, like the upstairs piazzas, to capture the prevailing southwest breeze. The effect is like a kite held aloft, suspended above the ever-present ballast of humid Lowcountry air.</p>
        <p>The densest concentration of Federal, Georgian and Greek Revival period houses is to be found on The Point, Beaufort's old neighborhood to the east of Carteret Street. Here stand about five dozen historic houses of exceptional architectural quality, most of them built with cotton profits, many of them accompanied by elaborately landscaped, if not formal, gardens.</p>
        <p>Bay Street, laid out in the early years of the 18th century, runs west along the river. Its houses, including an unusual one (1211 Bay Street), which combines the native skill of tabby building with a graceful, restrained Palladian portico, form an elegant front line behind which fall narrow streets lined with lovely smaller houses and churches. The graceful interior columns of St. Helena's Episcopal Church suggest the relative simplicity of Colonial-era architecture in a town where embellishment is more common. Its shady, walled cemetery, abundantly landscaped with indigenous plants and full of mockingbirds, is a good place to rest.</p>
        <p>An impressionistic history lesson can be obtained by making all of downtown Beaufort your classroom. Maps are available for free at the Chamber of Commerce (1006 Bay Street), where children and adults may rent bicycles ($4 an hour, $15 a day) or pick up a recorded cassette tour ($6). Horse-drawn carriage tours start here on the hour seven times a day from 10 to 4 ($7 for adults, $4 for children).</p>
        <p>At a time when the sheer scale of city life produces fatigue, Beaufort's small size is a relief. A visitor can fold into its routine and take up casual citizenship without doing much more than exploring the downtown historic district, resting on a porch swing, casting a shrimp net, hunting for fossilized shark's teeth, or eating outdoors as the sun sets. Subtle pleasures can be found in simply observing the comings and goings of small town life. Visitors to Beaufort this summer may even see Barbra Streisand or Nick Nolte, who will be there filming ''The Prince of Tides,'' a movie based on the best-selling novel by the Beaufort native Pat Conroy.</p>
        <p>Local people usually spend their free time on the water. Hunting Island State Park, with three miles of beach and a 115-year-old lighthouse with stairs to the top, is about 30 minutes away by car. Families of deer forage in full view in its maritime forest and clapper rails, herons and raccoons feed all day in the marsh. More than 125 bird species have been sighted here. In nearby Port Royal, a brand-new town boardwalk spans the marsh at the confluence of the Beaufort River and Battery Creek. Shark's teeth lie scattered, half-buried on the sandy shore. From a high platform aerie huge container ships can be seen coming and going at the commercial port.</p>
        <p>The tides still influence life in Beaufort, though few livelihoods depend on them anymore. Get to know them and you will come to recognize the change of smell in the air, the shifting of the breeze, the movement of shore birds and the best hours for fishing. Times of highs and lows for a week, measured at several locations, are listed daily in The Beaufort Gazette, which appears in curbside newspaper boxes at about 2 P.M.</p>
        <p>To talk over fishing strategies and to purchase basic tackle, step into Fordham Hardware (701 Bay Street). A bell jingles as you enter. The worn-smooth stone floor, the display windows and shelves stuffed and strung with merchandise, the bins of seed and nails, and the sweet, musty smell endow Fordham's with the authenticity of outdoor labor that slick gardening catalogues crave.</p>
        <p>Three-quarters of the way back, by the counter, are dip nets, cotton line and weights for catching fish and crabs. A good setup costs about $6. Monofilament shrimp nets, four-and-a-half-feet in diameter, a good size for beginners, cost $36. Beaufort Hardware (723 Bay Street), run, like Fordham's, by a local family for a couple of generations, sells fishing gear at comparable prices. Nonfishermen might enjoy a radio-controlled wooden sailboat or airplane. The recommended bait for crab is chicken necks, the older and more pungent the better; shrimp you encircle by stealth.</p>
        <p>If you are traveling with children, at least one of them will encrust a sneaker with sandy, souffle-like ''pluff'' mud from the creek. Lipsitz department store (825 Bay Street), another small-town emporium whose type has all but disappeared, can help. Members of the Lipsitz family will sell your family footwear, jeans and sweats while a chatty pet mynah bird diverts the younger set.</p>
        <p>Across Bay Street is the Waterfront Park, whose playground, landscaped green and harbor promenade are well-suited for games of catch or tag, or just walking. Cruise ships dock on scheduled stops, shrimp trawlers and sailboats tie up periodically and tugboats accompanying loaded barges follow a slow, steady course. Near the playground is an informative photo display depicting rural folk art and traditions.</p>
        <p>Hours of the day elicit their own pictures in Beaufort. In the early morning, they are noiseless and unpeopled. One might frame the massive stone pillars, mottled with age, at 411 Craven Street; another, the broad arc of oak branches on a tree in the yard of 1 Laurens Street, the house featured in ''The Big Chill'' and ''The Great Santini.'' At first dark of a spring evening, lamplight makes eyes of windows in houses on King Street. The fading light of sunset on the Bay Street bluff silhouettes the painted balustrades, railings and shutters of the houses facing south. When you return to your lodgings or walk to dinner, you will carry with you the scent of Confederate jasmine, still lingering in the warm air.</p>
        <p>The world of sea island plantations whose slaves helped create Beaufort's antebellum wealth, and the vast geography of water in which Beaufort is just a dot, can best be seen a short distance from town in the direction of the beaches or Port Royal.</p>
        <p>In the 1890's the historian Henry Adams would board a little steamer packet to ride to a house on the beach where, with a party of Washington friends, he would roast oysters, paint in watercolor and catch crabs. Today Highway 21 will carry you to Hunting Island State Park. If beachcombing and sunbathing aren't enough, the lighthouse can be climbed or bikes ridden on roads that weave through the maritime forest. At high tide the beach disappears due to severe erosion. Or walk the length of Paradise Pier - 1120 feet - which reaches into Fripp inlet at the south end of the island.</p>
        <p>Or your way you may want to stop for lunch at the Shrimp Shack, a small, rustic restaurant on the side of the road, across from the owner's excellent dockside fish market. Or if the tide is low and coming in, cast a net from Cowan Creek bridge, or in the big bend at Village Creek, two popular fishing spots. Or visit Penn Center on St. Helena Island.</p>
        <p>Penn was established in 1862 as a school for the newly-freed slaves by two female abolitionists and has remained a proud center of community life ever since. The York W. Bailey Museum (open Monday to Friday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.) displays artifacts from Penn's educational mission, past and present, and objects confirming the close ties between African and slave life, which has produced a culture called Gullah. Community singing sessions, open to the public, feature a program of spirituals and readings. They take place at 7:30 P.M. every third Sunday from September to May.</p>
        <p>The crescent beach off Sixth Street in Port Royal, locally referred to as The Sands, and its adjacent marsh boardwalk, are about seven miles from Beaufort. The boardwalk and 45-foot-high viewing tower offer a panoramic view of the harbor, of Parris Island, the Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot, and of freighters like the Repap, which carries raw materials for glossy paper coating to Canada, and returns with the paper.</p>
        <p>As Beaufort has become more prosperous it seems able, for the first time, to praise its small town roots as much as its Old South status. The Lowcountry Ledger, a new, thoughtful and determinedly local weekly newspaper, runs a column called ''Old Times Are Not Forgotten.'' It is a compilation of old newspaper items that chronicle church picnics, socials, the pranks of local boys and 100-year-old business gossip. It is a charming celebration of small town life. It never mentions the Old Families or the Old South.</p>
        <p>The editor says it is the most popular feature in the paper.</p>
        <p>A VISITOR'S GUIDE TO BEAUFORT</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>The closest airport to Beaufort is at Savannah, Ga., just under an hour's drive by car. Charleston Airport is about 90 minutes away, but it's a pretty ride to Beaufort on Highway 17, the old coast road through the rural Lowcountry marshes and former rice fields.</p>
        <p>What to See</p>
        <p>Following are some of the sights of the area. The area code is 803.</p>
        <p>The Greater Beaufort Chamber of Commerce has a visitor center at 1006 Bay Street. More information: Post Office Box 910, Beaufort, S.C. 29901; 524-3163.</p>

Ask about reservations for cabin rental here; camping sites must be secured at the campground. Fishing fees are $1.50 per rod at Paradise Pier. Rods and tackle are available for rent ($10) and there's bait for sale.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Beaufort's recent prosperity has brought a variety of lodgings to the area.</p>
        <p>The proprietors of the Rhett House Inn (1009 Craven Street; 524-9030) who used to be in the New York fashion business, have converted an antebellum house a block back from the river into an eight-room bed and breakfast with a look that wears well in the hot weather. There's lots of natural light, antique furniture, pretty patterned fabrics and a library table piled with glossy magazines. Double rooms start at $80, including breakfast; $15 extra for a third person in the room. No children under 5.</p>
        <p>The Trescot Inn (500 Washington Street; 522-8552) has six rooms priced from $65 for double occupancy, including breakfast. Its second-story veranda, which is nearly 50 feet long and 12 feet wide, overlooks drifts of azaleas, cedar trees and vine-covered fences in the Point neighborhood. No children under 12.</p>
        <p>There are three bedrooms in the Old Point Inn (212 New Street; 524-3177) with Victorian touches such as lace curtains and gingham-style wallpaper that correspond with the turn-of-the-century date of the house. From the upstairs porch you can see the boat traffic and the twinkling lights of Ladies Island. Rates, including breakfast, start at $55 for a double room.</p>
        <p>The Best Western Sea Island Inn (1015 Bay Street; 524-4121) has a convenient downtown location, attractively decorated rooms and a pool. Through the high season to Oct. 31, rates start at $58 for a double room. The Cafe is open for Continental breakfast every and lunch every day except Sunday.</p>
        <p>Places to Eat</p>
        <p>Nearly every menu in Beaufort includes locally caught seafood. Following are some of the more popular places: The Gadsby Tavern (525-1800) and Plum's (525-1946) open out onto the Waterfront Park and are loose, informal places, especially at lunch. Gadsby's often features live acoustic music Friday and Saturday night. Lunch prices are about $4 to $6 for entrees or a good soup-and-salad combination. At Plum's there are hefty sandwiches (from about $2.50 to $5) and homemade ice cream starting at $1.30.</p>
        <p>For dinner, The Steamer on Highway 21 on Ladies Island (524-1755) is the most popular place in town, with consistently good seafood dishes and oysters by the bucket. It's noisy and service can be slow. Entrees from about $10, depending on the specials.</p>
        <p>Wilkop's Whitehall Inn (524-0382) also just off Highway 21 on Ladies Island and The Anchorage at 1103 Bay Street (524-9392) are more formal. The Anchorage has rooms of dark paneling, Wilkop's is set in a lovely live oak grove facing the river. Menus emphasize local seafood, especially shrimp and crab, and there are full wine lists. Dinner for two runs about $40 to $50, including wine. The Shrimp Shack (838-2962) on St. Helena Island or the Dockside (524-7433) in Port Royal offer abundant platters of seafood, slaw and hush puppies. The Dockside is right on the water and offers one of the prettiest sunset views around. Entrees are from $8.50; from about $5 at the Shrimp Shack.</p>
