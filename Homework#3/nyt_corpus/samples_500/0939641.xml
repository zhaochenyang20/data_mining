        <p>Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, today denied a published report that his office was investigating the personal life of President Clinton while he was Governor of Arkansas.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued this afternoon, Mr. Starr called ''incorrect'' an article in The Washington Post that said he was investigating Mr. Clinton's personal life by interviewing former and current state troopers in Arkansas about their knowledge of any extramarital relationships Mr. Clinton may have had.</p>
        <p>Previously published accounts have said the troopers alleged that Mr. Clinton had such affairs. The Post article said that the questioning ''marks a sharp departure from previous avenues of inquiry in the three-year-old investigation'' of the Whitewater matter.</p>
        <p>Federal agents from the Whitewater independent counsel's office have been talking to state troopers in Arkansas about Mr. Clinton's relationships with women since 1994, when the independent counsel was Robert B. Fiske Jr., people involved in the investigation said. They said the investigators conducted the interviews as part of an effort to corroborate other information that they had about Mr. Clinton's financial dealings with his former Whitewater partner, James B. McDougal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr would not say who has been interviewed by his staff, but he said in his statement that there was nothing improper about seeking information from all possible sources that might bear on his examination of Mr. Clinton's financial dealings.</p>
