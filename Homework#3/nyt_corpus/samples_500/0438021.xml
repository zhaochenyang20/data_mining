        <p>After two weeks of tabloid headlines, "Geraldo" shows and dark gossip, all stemming from an allegation of rape at the Kennedy compound in Palm Beach, Fla., Senator Edward M. Kennedy went to American University today to recall the glory days of the Kennedy family.</p>
        <p>Most of his speech was a smoothly delivered, impassioned appeal for a comprehensive new effort to aid children. But because the event was organized by the university to recall a major address delivered there 28 years ago by President John F. Kennedy, the Senator looked back as well. When he did, he struggled several times for composure.</p>
        <p>It was one more scene in the familiar morality play that has played out in Washington in recent days, on the two images of Edward Kennedy: the powerful Senator who is caretaker of the family legacy and the hard-drinking roue.</p>
        <p>While the accusation of rape was leveled against William Kennedy Smith, the Senator's nephew, the Senator was engulfed in the furor, particularly in the first days after the March 30 incident. Critics noted that the episode occurred after the 59-year-old Senator had spent the evening at a bar with his nephew and son. Many cited the memory of Chappaquiddick, and some raised the possibility of a cover-up.</p>
        <p>Old Kennedy loyalists rose to the Senator's defense and railed at what they saw as the unfairness of the news coverage. "I've taken my nephew out and had beers with him, and I don't think it's an offense," said Bob Shrum, a former Kennedy speech writer and Democratic political consultant. "I don't think anybody else does either."</p>
        <p>Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the conservative Republican from Utah who is Mr. Kennedy's friend, said: "I did tell him, if I hear of any more of these things, I'm going to send the Mormon missionaries to him. He said, 'I'm about ready.' "</p>
        <p>But attempts at humor were faltering. "I feel sorry for all the Kennedys," said Mr. Hatch. He added, "I certainly feel sorry for the young woman, too."</p>
        <p>In the halls of Congress, some of Mr. Kennedy's colleagues in the Senate shook their heads and marveled at how, as one Democratic Senator put it, "The guy just can't seem to get out from under a black cloud." The Reaction Is Polarized</p>
        <p>The reaction, as is so often the case with the Kennedys, was fiercely polarized. A column in The Boston Globe by Mike Barnicle declared: "Surrounded by sycophants, Edward Kennedy thinks his name and title are license to do whatever he wants, and apparently the only voice he hears in that dark lonely time before danger calls is the drink saying, 'Go ahead, you can get away with anything.' " Mr. Barnicle asserted that Mr. Kennedy, who is not up for re-election until 1994, was finished in politics.</p>
        <p>That same day, The Globe ran another column, by Dave Nyhan, headlined, "Flaws, yes -- but Kennedy still champions the little guy."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy, meanwhile, went about his duties. His press secretary said he was "concerned but not distracted from his work," and his schedule seemed intended to underscore that. He voted against the nomination of Kenneth L. Ryskamp, a Federal District judge in Miami, to an important appellate court seat; held a hearing on the Kurdish refugees; conducted a news conference about military-base closings; delivered today's speech at American University. Liberal Standard-Bearer</p>
        <p>Even many of his critics acknoweldge that Mr. Kennedy is one of the most influential Senators on Capitol Hill, perhaps the most visible standard-bearer for liberal causes. Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research organization, said Mr. Kennedy's occasional appearances in the tabloids were unlikely to change that. "It's happened again and again, and I think it's discounted inside the chamber," said Mr. Mann.</p>
        <p>"What it does is sort of underscore the limits of Ted Kennedy's role in national politics," Mr. Mann added. Controversies involving Mr. Kennedy and his family are no longer viewed through the prism of a possible Presidential campaign, the Brookings analyst said.</p>
        <p>As the days have passed, Mr. Kennedy's allies have noted that the focus of Palm Beach controversy has moved away from the Senator. His speech today at American University was planned well before the Palm Beach episode occurred but offered him an opportunity to talk of issues and the family's golden era.</p>
        <p>The university was commemorating a commencement address delivered there on June 10, 1963, in which President Kennedy announced that the United States, British and Soviet Governments had agreed to convene new negotiations in Moscow on a treaty to ban nuclear-weapons tests. He spelled out "a strategy of peace" and said what he hoped for was not "a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war" but "genuine peace."</p>
        <p>As for today's appearance by a different Kennedy, there were attempts to organize a protest, but only a handful appeared. A few said the money for the Kennedy commemoration could have been better spent; a few said they challenged Mr. Kennedy's "moral fitness" to be Senator.</p>
        <p>But the audience was large and respectful.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy drew applause as he urged the creation of a $10 billion new effort for chidren's education and health, including $5 billion in Federal funds -- "or six days' cost of running the Department of Defense." Alone With His Thoughts</p>
        <p>His delivery was smooth until he reached the close of his speech, when he began to talk about his brother. "Some of the most moving photographs of President Kennedy portray him in the Oval Office -- not with heads of state or Cabinet members -- but with his son and daughter," Mr. Kennedy said. "I think of his warm smile as he watched Caroline and John play hide-and-seek around his desk."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy stopped speaking, looked down intently at his speech, and paused for a very long time. It happened two or three times more before he finished. "After the passage of so many years, those photographs are still extremely moving," he said. "They tell us something not only about my brother, but about Americans as a people."</p>
        <p>The students, most of whom were not born when those photographs were taken, listened quietly and gave Mr. Kennedy a standing ovation when he ended. With the smooth advance work that the Kennedys are known for, the Senator left quickly, with a large pack of reporters at his heels, calling his name.</p>
