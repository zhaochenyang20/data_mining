        <p>WITH the world reeling from disasters, both natural and man-made, a wandering sports columnist is sometimes a few days behind or ahead of tragedy. For all that, there were great events and charismatic athletes -- in addition to memorable datelines for a new set of postcards.</p>
        <p>PORT ST. LUCIE, FLA., FEB. 17 -- On a coast recently disfigured by hurricanes, spring training begins. Two former rivals, Willie Randolph and Pedro Martínez, are united as the Mets' manager and their ace. Martínez will give Randolph a superlative season, on and off the field.</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, MARCH 2 -- Jackie Robinson, the pioneer Brooklyn Dodger, is honored with the Congressional Gold Medal in the Capitol Rotunda as dozens of black lawmakers attend. President Bush and Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, share a rare moment of bipartisan agreement in praising Robinson.</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, MARCH 17 -- Mark McGwire is the most visibly pathetic of five baseball stars testifying before Congress, declining to address his use of a body-building drug. Rafael Palmeiro will be humbled in August, when he is suspended for 10 games after testing positive for steroids. Before the year is out, pressure from Congress will shame the union and the owners into accepting much stricter penalties.</p>
        <p>BIRMINGHAM, ALA., MARCH 29 -- Roderick Jackson, a teacher and family man, jeopardized his livelihood by taking on the school board for the right of his girls basketball team to have facilities matching the boys'. Today he quietly celebrates a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision that essentially protects whistleblowers. Then he excuses himself to go back to his students.</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, APRIL 14 -- After 33 years, baseball returns to D.C. as the relocated Montreal Expos, now the Washington Nationals, defeat Arizona, 5-3. Frank Robinson's team will finish with a respectable 81-81 record and draw 2.7 million fans, eighth best in the National League.</p>
        <p>BOSTON, APRIL 11 -- Two classes in nearby Acton, Mass., have proposed that the Yankees and the Red Sox shake hands at the home opener, in a gesture of sportsmanship. Although this is not about to happen, most Yankees do sit respectfully in the dugout to observe the Boston sports heroes Johnny Pesky, Bobby Doerr, Dominic DiMaggio, Bill Russell, Bobby Orr, Tedy Bruschi and Richard Seymour take the field as the Red Sox receive their 2004 World Series rings.</p>
        <p>AUGUSTA, GA., APRIL 18 -- Lance Armstrong, not yet 34, announces he will retire after this summer's Tour de France. Then he leads his Discovery Channel team for a week's romp in the Tour de Georgia.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK, MAY 25 -- Stunned Italian fans put aside old regional rivalries and root for A.C. Milan at L'Angolo in Greenwich Village. On television from far-off Istanbul, Liverpool ties the score after trailing at halftime, 3-0, then beats Milan on penalty kicks, in one of the greatest reversals in a Champions League final.</p>
        <p>LONDON, JUNE 29 -- It's not every day that a Yank sports columnist walks up to 10 Downing Street and interviews Tony Blair. Blair will travel to Singapore in a few hours to promote London's candidacy to be the 2012 Olympic host. Paris has the perceived edge, but Blair's competitive streak is matched by that of Sebastian Coe, the track gold medalist and the leader of the London bid group.</p>
        <p>WIMBLEDON, England, JULY 3 -- A stunned Andy Roddick wins only 12 games from Roger Federer in three sets in the Wimbledon final, and says, ''I want it real bad, but he's beating me.'' A day earlier, Venus Williams outlasted Lindsay Davenport in a tense three-set final.</p>
        <p>PARIS, JULY 6 -- With a dark cloud dropping sprinkles over City Hall, at 1:49 p.m., Parisians learn the host of the 2012 Summer Games. ''Londres, London,'' says a voice from distant Singapore. The Parisians scuttle away, almost silently. New York's impractical dream of a mixed-use West Side facility has been mercifully rejected.</p>
        <p>NANCY, FRANCE, JULY 7 -- Driving to catch up with the Tour de France, I hear on French radio descriptions of terrorist bombings in London, where we were taking the Underground and buses a few days earlier.</p>
        <p>KARLSRUHE, GERMANY, JULY 8  -- ''I'm more afraid than in the past,'' Armstrong admits in a morning cellphone chat. Going for his seventh straight championship, Armstrong says he plans to avoid nasty collisions on this rainy day, knowing his mates will protect him.</p>
        <p>COURCHEVEL, FRANCE, JULY 12  -- Armstrong regains the lead in the Tour, even though he appears to ease up from the saddle during a close uphill finish in the Alps, allowing a young Spaniard to win the stage. Lance knows what he needs, day by day.</p>
        <p>ST-LARY-SOULAN, FRANCE, JULY 17 -- Paying homage to a friend, Fabio Casartelli, who died in a crash on this course 10 years earlier, Armstrong maintains his lead. His chief blocker, big George Hincapie, wins his first stage in a tense climb high in the Pyrenees.</p>
        <p>GAILLAC, FRANCE, JULY 20 -- My wife and I vote this the most perfect evening of the Tour -- dinner with my cousin Jen and her husband, Sam, in La Verrerie, a tiny auberge in the woods, under a full moon, two fish courses, great wine. Circling this beautiful country, we feel privileged to revisit Nancy, Strasbourg, Grenoble, Montpelier, Pau, Toulouse, Lyon. Months later, we will follow the urban unrest in French cities.</p>
        <p>ST-ÉTIENNE, FRANCE, JULY 23 -- Armstrong wins the time trial to clinch his championship. Tomorrow he will cycle into drizzly Paris to celebrate. But the sport is haunted by suggestions of widespread drug use by some riders.</p>
        <p>PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y., SEPT. 1 -- Many a sports journalist has spent time in New Orleans, now devastated by Hurricane Katrina. I mourn for the people of that unique city, and rage at the ineptitude of public officials.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK, SEPT. 10 and 11 -- At Flushing Meadows, two of the most popular and athletic players in the game, Roger Federer and Kim Clijsters, win the United States Open this weekend. The best match? Andre Agassi dispatching the local favorite, James Blake, in a five-set late-night quarterfinal.</p>
        <p>BOSTON, OCT. 7 -- Last year they were idiots. The year before they were cowboys. This year the Red Sox are history, going down in three straight games in the first round to another ancient franchise, the White Sox.</p>
        <p>CHICAGO, OCT. 23 -- After yet another umpiring call goes their way, the White Sox take a 2-0 lead in the World Series. ''Maybe it's Shoeless Joe,'' says Brad Ausmus, the astute Houston catcher, perhaps sensing that the White Sox are about to exorcise the gloomy spell dating to Joe Jackson and the scandalous 1919 Black Sox.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK, NOV. 5 -- After a year's absence because of a labor dispute, hockey is back, with more wide-open play under new rules.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK, NOV. 16 -- Nine fans jam into a Brooklyn apartment to watch Trinidad and Tobago play Bahrain for the first World Cup berth for one of the teams. Before the game, Paul Caligiuri of the United States, who helped beat T&amp;T 16 years earlier to keep it out of the World Cup, calls my cellphone to wish luck to the fans. Two hours later, the Trinis are happy.</p>
        <p>SEATTLE, NOV. 27 -- Jay Feely misses three late field goals for the Giants, then has the character to address reporters. The surging Seahawks seem likely to play host to a playoff game or two in January.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK, NOV. 30 -- Tony Stewart, winner of the Nextel Cup, burns rubber in the canyons of Midtown as Nascar celebrates its new TV contract and its growth around the United States.</p>
        <p>LEIPZIG, GERMANY, DEC. 9 -- Bach and Mendelssohn once composed in this tiny city in the eastern part of the country. Now FIFA holds its draw for the 2006 World Cup, putting the United States in a rugged group with the Czech Republic, Italy and Ghana. I wonder how many of the 12 host cities I will be able to visit in 2006 -- for epic games, for new postcards. In the meantime, Happy New Year.</p>
