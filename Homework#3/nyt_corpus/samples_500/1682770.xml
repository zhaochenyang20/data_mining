        <p>After years of wearing the word ''dysfunctional'' like a hair shirt, the New York State Legislature proved that it is actually capable of working. As this year's session ends, legislators and Gov. George Pataki can finally boast that for the first time in years, they operated in a more open way to produce a far better product.</p>
        <p>Legislators changed some of their worst rules, starting with the most basic -- they ended the embarrassing policy of allowing members to have their vote recorded as ''yes'' on every bill while they were out of the chamber or even out of the city. They also passed the first on-time budget in 21 years -- with far more openness than usual. And, in the last few days, they have agreed to some of the most important reforms in decades:</p>
        <p>A law to require lobbyists to report any effort to influence state contracts. These contracts are worth billions of dollars a year, but reform-minded legislators and activists have despaired at getting them covered by the basic state lobbying rules. The lobbyists involved, who included friends and relatives of Albany's top politicians, were simply deemed too powerful. Perhaps the difference this year was the publicity over some particularly unsavory transactions -- like the whopping $500,000 fee paid to former Senator Alfonse D'Amato for one phone call to lobby the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
        <p>Closing an outrageous loophole in the ethics law so that state employees can no longer escape ethics charges by simply resigning from their jobs.</p>
        <p>An agreement -- at last -- to have legislative sessions broadcast statewide, the way Congress is on C-Span. Although there is reasonable worry about the effect television lights will have on attention-starved lawmakers, the public deserves a chance to see their representatives in action, whatever the highs and lows.</p>
        <p>A long-awaited law requiring computerization of election records around the state, a measure that Common Cause and New York Public Interest Research Group had been pushing intently since they sent researchers around the state and found illegible records and irascible clerks guarding them from the public eye.</p>
        <p>Expansion of the Freedom of Information Law, which allows public access to state documents.</p>
        <p>A long-overdue move to make the secretive world of public-private authorities more transparent.</p>
        <p>Another achievement brought back reminders that there was a time when New York's Legislature was actually regarded as a model for other states, and not a terrible example of what not to do. Legislators set an example for the federal government by voting to make emergency contraception available without a prescription.</p>
        <p>Why so much energy, so much substance? For one, Albany got a lot of bad press. Even more, several incumbents were defeated or almost defeated, sending a new chill through the Capitol.</p>
        <p>The bottom line is that a Legislature that seemed almost irredeemable has started to redeem itself. Sure, there are some things we would prefer not to see, a few inside deals that slipped through the night. There are also some big reforms -- of the campaign financing system, for example -- that are still needed. But now we know that New York's legislators can actually deliver if they try hard enough.</p>
