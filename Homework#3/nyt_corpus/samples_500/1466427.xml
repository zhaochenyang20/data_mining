        <p>* Brown-Forman Corp., Louisville, Ky., expanded its relationship with Universal McCann, New York, by consolidating the worldwide media planning and buying for its wine and liquor brands like Jack Daniel's, Finlandia and Southern Comfort and naming Universal McCann as global agency of record. Billings were estimated at $60 million. Universal McCann, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, already handled media duties in countries like France and Spain. Media planning for the United States had been handled by the St. Louis office of PHD, part of the Omnicom Group, and domestic media buying had been handled internally. Creative duties for the brands are divided among various agencies.  * Hoffman/Lewis, San Francisco, was awarded the accounts of three California companies that had previously handled their advertising internally. Total billings were estimated at $15 million. The companies are: Beverages and More, Concord, which operates 28 stores; Earthbound Farm, San Juan Bautista, a supplier of organic produce; and VSP, a provider of eye-care plans, for a brand-awareness campaign.</p>
