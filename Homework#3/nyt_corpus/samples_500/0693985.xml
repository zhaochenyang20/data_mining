        <p>Beginning an investigation into a possible misuse of Federal, state and city funds, United States postal agents yesterday confiscated reams of files from the headquarters of a Brooklyn school district and from a private Hasidic school within the district, officials said.</p>
        <p>More than a dozen agents of the Postal Inspection Service descended on the two sites of the United Talmudical Academy of Williamsburg and the main office of Community School District 14, seizing files and sealing the door to the district's headquarters.</p>
        <p>The raid marked the start of a joint investigation by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District and the city school system's Special Commissioner of Investigations into possible misuse of Federal money for poor children known as Chapter 1 aid, said an official familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity. Investigators will also be searching for possible misuse of city and state funds from the Board of Education, the official said.</p>
        <p>Outside District 14's offices at 215 Heyward Street in Williamsburg yesterday, postal agents wheeled out boxes and whole file cabinets, stacking them in cars and an Express Mail truck. Computers, packed in plastic and covered with stickers marked "Evidence," were also carted off. Telephone calls to District 14 officials yesterday were not returned.</p>
        <p>Federal agents also seized files from the Talmudical Academy's two locations, Bnos Yakov and Samet MH Rabbi, at 62 Harrison Avenue, and 253 Keap Street, a spokesman for the academy said. Tensions in District</p>
        <p>District 14, which spans the Williamsburg and Greenpoint sections of Brooklyn, has been rocked by tensions between its majority white school board, whose members are supported by the Orthodox Jewish community and the Catholic Church, and the black and Hispanic population whose children are the majority in the district's public schools.</p>
        <p>Although most Hasidic children attend private schools, they receive Federal and state money through the public school district. In particular, Hasidic schools in Williamsburg rely heavily on Chapter 1 funds for English and math education.</p>
        <p>Chapter 1 is the Federal Government's main effort to improve basic academic skills of poor children. About 5.5 million children in two-thirds of the nation's public schools are served by the multibillion-dollar program, 70 percent of them in elementary grades. The program also pays for breakfast and lunch for these children.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Leib Glanz, the academy's executive director, said through a spokesman yesterday that agents arrived at the school's sites and asked for various files, including those dealing with Chapter 1 funds.</p>
        <p>"The administration of the school is cooperating fully," he said through the spokesman.</p>
        <p>Officials from the El Puente Academy, a small public high school located in Williamsburg, became temporarily ensnarled in the raid when they tried to pick up paychecks, which they eventually got, said Luis Garden Acosta, the executive director of the El Puente community organization.</p>
        <p>"We assured them that we had nothing to do with District 14, and we got our checks after we signed a thousand pieces of paper and they photocopied everything," Mr. Garden Acosta said.</p>
