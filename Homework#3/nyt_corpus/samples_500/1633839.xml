        <p>Airbus, as expected, won approval from its controlling shareholders to produce a midsize long-distance jet to compete with the 7E7 from Boeing. The plane, known as the A350, will come in two versions, one seating 245 passengers, the other 285. The A350 will enter service in the first half of 2010. Airbus, controlled by EADS, did not disclose the plane's budget or whether it would seek loans from European governments to finance it. Boeing's rival plane is scheduled to go into service in 2008.</p>
