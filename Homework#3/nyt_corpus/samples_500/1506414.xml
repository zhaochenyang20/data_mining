        <p>A man whose eyes were gouged during a scuffle with his roommate died in the hospital of a heart attack on Sunday, four days after the argument, the police said yesterday. The man, Oscar Herrera, 53, of East Elmhurst, and his roommate, Hector Castillo, 51, were arguing over a broken television antenna in their home at 100-30 Ditmars Boulevard. Mr. Castillo gouged Mr. Herrera's eyes with his fingers and fingernails, the police said. Both were arrested, and Mr. Castillo was charged with assault. Mr. Herrera suffered a heart attack at Elmhurst Hospital Center and died on Sunday night. The medical examiner's office will determine whether the death was linked to the assault, the police said.</p>
