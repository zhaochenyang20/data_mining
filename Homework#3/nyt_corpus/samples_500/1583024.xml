        <p>Editorial says Republican leaders from House and Senate produced irresponsible compromise on federal budget resolution allowing one more year of deficit-financed tax cuts, amounting to $28 billion, which House just passed; says only hope for fiscal sanity lies with Senate</p>

        <p>Republican leaders from the House and Senate produced an irresponsible compromise on the federal budget resolution this week, which the House dutifully passed yesterday. The only hope for fiscal sanity now lies with the Senate, where members can retain their self-respect by refusing to cough up the necessary votes.</p>
        <p>For months, the House and Senate have clashed over the latest round of President Bush's tax cuts. A narrow majority in the Senate insisted that the cuts should be paid for with offsetting spending reductions or increased taxes in other areas. The House Republicans and the Bush administration resisted -- undoubtedly because they know that there would be no way to compensate for tax cuts that would amount to an estimated $1.2 trillion over 10 years.</p>

        <p>Republican leaders from the House and Senate produced an irresponsible compromise on the federal budget resolution this week, which the House dutifully passed yesterday. The only hope for fiscal sanity now lies with the Senate, where members can retain their self-respect by refusing to cough up the necessary votes.</p>
        <p>For months, the House and Senate have clashed over the latest round of President Bush's tax cuts. A narrow majority in the Senate insisted that the cuts should be paid for with offsetting spending reductions or increased taxes in other areas. The House Republicans and the Bush administration resisted -- undoubtedly because they know that there would be no way to compensate for tax cuts that would amount to an estimated $1.2 trillion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>In the compromise, the conferees agreed to extend three key tax cuts for one year rather than permanently, as originally sought, and to enact a ''pay as you go'' rule for one year. But -- a big, big but -- the one-year ''pay as you go'' rule would not apply to the one-year extension of the three tax cuts. Presto! The new federal budget resolution allows for one more year of deficit-financed tax cuts, to the tune of some $28 billion.</p>
        <p>This compromise is a bad election-year joke. Turning large, expensive chunks of the tax code into year-by-year renewals is no way to do tax policy. And an obsessive urge to pass unpaid-for tax cuts is no way to run a country.</p>
