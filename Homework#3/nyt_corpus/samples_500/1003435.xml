        <p>Was there ever a time in American art when so many conflicting impulses and imperatives converged as in the first two decades of this century?</p>
        <p>Victorian sentimentality bumped into social reform, which in turn came up against the formalist revolutions of the European avant-garde. No wonder young artists of the period were either exhilarated or confused, or a little bit of both.</p>
        <p>Among those exhilarated was the photographer Paul Strand (1890-1976), whose early work is the subject of a thought-provoking exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Organized by Maria Morris Hambourg, curator of photography at the Met, ''Paul Strand Circa 1916'' brings together some 60 pictures made between 1911, when the artist was barely past his student years, and 1917.</p>
        <p>Strand was in every way a product of his complex time. Born and reared on Manhattan's Upper West Side, the child of a comfortable Jewish family, he was sent to the Ethical Culture School for an education that gave equal weight to individual creativity and social engagement.</p>
        <p>His high school art teacher was no less a figure than the great documentary photographer and sociologist Lewis Hine. And it was Hine who took Strand on a class trip to the Fifth Avenue gallery of Alfred Stieglitz, where the tradition-shattering art of modernist Europe would within a few years find an American home.</p>
        <p>At the time of Strand's visit in 1907, however, Stieglitz's interests still lay elsewhere. He was championing the photographic movement known as Pictorialism, in which the painterly treatment of prints and the use of poetic subjects were seen as ways to establish photography's status as a high-art medium.</p>
        <p>Several of the photographers Stieglitz favored -- Clarence White, Edward Steichen, Gertrude Kasebier, Alvin Langdon Coburn, George H. Seeley and Adolph de Meyer, among them -- are included in a small exhibition at the Met titled ''Pictorialism in New York, 1900-1915,'' which was organized by Laura Muir and serves as a prologue to the Strand show. And from work like White's familiar ''Morning'' (1898), with its white-robed woman wandering, crystal ball in hand, through a mist to de Meyer's gauzy society portraits, the movement's attractions as well as its deeply conservative inclinations are clear.</p>
        <p>Strand experimented with the style. Among the first works in the Met show is his 1910 picture of a grove of trees filtered through a kind of palpitating tonal haze. But it was Stieglitz himself, with ideas about art much changed in the wake of the revolutionary Armory Show of 1913, who in 1915 steered the young artist toward ''straight photography,'' involving minimal handwork and real-life subjects.</p>
        <p>Strand took his mentor's advice seriously, but selectively (he continued to manipulate his prints). And a trip across the United States that year produced an extraordinary mix of images. His picture of the classical pillars of the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco harked back to an idealizing style. A shot of telegraph poles leaning across a bleak Texas landscape was something new. In an unsystematic way, Strand was juggling the influence of Stieglitz and Hine, and it was this blend of approaches that he brought back to New York.</p>
        <p>They merge in one of his most famous pictures, ''Wall Street'' (1915), a shot of lower Manhattan office workers walking to their jobs and dwarfed by the then-new J. P. Morgan building. On the one hand, the picture's play of geometric forms is a brilliant exercise in formal calculation. On the other, the colossal scale and unanswering darkness of the building's windows suggest the crushing corporate power that lay within.</p>
        <p>Both of these components, the esthetic and the social, interweave, sometimes deliberately, sometimes serendipitously, in much of Strand's youthful work. And then they separate out, as they seem to have done during the summer of 1916, which he spent at his family's house in Twin Lakes, Conn.</p>
        <p>In this bucolic setting, Strand applied some of the monumentality of his Manhattan photos to domestic objects, turning glazed mixing bowls and Cezannesque apples and pears into Cubistic still lifes carved from shadow and light. Even more radically, he shot patterns of sunlight streaming through chair slats and porch railings, to create entirely abstract photographs, the first of their kind intended as such. Finally, he tilted his camera skyward to catch, at a vertiginous angle, the corner of a porch roof sailing against a sea of moving clouds.</p>
        <p>This rapturous, inebriate vision, so simple and so liberating, can best be understood as part of the conceptual free fall that European modernism inspired. In his sky pictures, Strand is looking at ''nothing,'' but his decision to look at it and then to award it photographic attention is what's important. It makes the fact of attention itself, with its mix of accident and choice, an important component of art, as Marcel Duchamp and other progressive artists realized.</p>
        <p>But progressive is a tricky idea. What constitutes advanced thinking in art and advanced thinking in life are by no means always the same thing. It is possible, in fact, to regard Strand's Twin Lakes photographs, formally daring as they are, as updated extensions of Pictorialism's hothouse escapist esthetic.</p>
        <p>Maybe Strand, to some degree, thought so, for in the same year he produced a series of urban portraits clearly influenced by his first teacher, Lewis Hine.</p>
        <p>Hine, who spent years photographing immigrants on Ellis Island, saw his own work not as muckraking reform journalism but as a form of social propaganda shaping, through art, a record of what John Dewey called America's ''moral democracy.''</p>
        <p>Strand's street photos of 1916, taken with a special camera designed to capture his subjects unawares, emulate Hines's engaged stance. He focused on the city's rich cultural mix (two Orthodox Jewish men deep in conversation; an elderly woman with a time-creased face sitting in Washington Square Park). But he also portrayed its dispossessed, as in the picture of a disheveled woman giving a spectacular yawn and a man with dazed eyes seen in the Irish slum neighborhood in lower Manhattan known as the Five Points.</p>
        <p>Did the immediacy of these living subjects unnerve Strand, even scare him? The human figure would become a central theme of his career, though increasingly he presented it carefully posed and expressively distanced, transformed -- despite a veneer of sociological frankness -- into a still life.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the final entries in the Met show suggest a retreat, however temporary, into the controlled realm of formalism and abstraction. The photographs from 1917 are almost entirely tightly framed close-ups of automobiles and repeated overhead shots of the empty, walled backyard of the artist's Upper West Side family home.</p>
        <p>When he made these pictures, there was good reason to seek comfort in the familiar. The country had been sucked into World War I, and Strand was drafted for service. By the time he was discharged two years later, the era of sky's-the-limit optimism was gone, and New York's artistic avant-garde had more or less dispersed.</p>
        <p>Strand still had a long career of films and books ahead of him. But his early pictures are special. Political art and formalism are usually taken to be either-or propositions. In America at the beginning of this century, as in Russia later, attempts were made to unite them: to frame the social subject, however humble, in a language of advanced visual ideas. It was a quixotic goal, both admirable and foolhardy. But ''Paul Strand Circa 1916'' tells the story, beautifully, of one artist finding that subject, learning that language, and every now and then persuading them to meet.</p>
        <p>''Paul Strand Circa 1916'' and ''Pictorialism in New York, 1900-1915'' remain at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, through May 31. ''Paul Strand Circa 1916'' travels to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (June 19-Sept. 15).  PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW</p>
