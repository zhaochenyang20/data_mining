        <p>Michael Jackson came to suspect the motives of the family of the boy who later accused him of sexual misconduct, and banished them from his Neverland ranch and stopped giving them expensive gifts, Mr. Jackson's lawyer said on Tuesday.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Michael Jackson came to suspect the motives of the family of the boy who later accused him of sexual misconduct, and banished them from his Neverland ranch and stopped giving them expensive gifts, Mr. Jackson's lawyer said on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The mother of the boy saw Mr. Jackson as a benefactor who would buy her a house, pay for college for her children and support her for the rest of her life, said Mr. Jackson's lead lawyer, Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., who made the charges in his opening statement, which he concluded Tuesday morning.</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Jackson grew suspicious and cut the family off, the mother retaliated by consulting a lawyer and concocting a story of sexual abuse of her son, a cancer survivor who was 13 years old at the time of the alleged incidents, Mr. Mesereau said.</p>
        <p>''When she realized that she couldn't make millions of dollars one way, she looked for another way, and here we are,'' Mr. Mesereau said. He said the mother had numerous contacts with law enforcement and child welfare officials immediately after the alleged abuse occurred, and never reported it.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Jackson flat-out denies these allegations,'' Mr. Mesereau said. ''They are false.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mesereau has made it clear that he intends to question aggressively the credibility and the motives of the accuser's mother. He has portrayed her as a serial liar who has tried to extort money from celebrities by using her son's cancer as a hook. Mr. Jackson was her chief prey, Mr. Mesereau said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mesereau at one point raised the possibility that Mr. Jackson would take the stand.</p>
        <p>''Michael will tell you one time he got a very bad feeling at Neverland,'' Mr. Mesereau said, referring to his suspicions about the accuser's family. He also said Mr. Jackson ''will freely admit that he does read girlie magazines from time to time.''</p>
        <p>Putting Mr. Jackson on the stand could be risky for the defense because it would subject him to cross-examination. Mr. Jackson is not on the list of 370 witnesses provided by the defense before the start of the trial. A spokeswoman for Mr. Jackson said Tuesday that his lawyers had not decided whether to call him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mesereau also directly addressed charges by prosecutors that Mr. Jackson had provided alcohol to the accuser as a prelude to sexually molesting him. He denied that vehemently but said the boy and his younger brother had broken into liquor supplies at Neverland on several occasions and had been caught drunk by household staff members. He said the accuser and his brother and sister had memorized security codes in the house and figured out how to operate the carnival rides on the property. He said the children threw objects from the top of a Ferris wheel onto one of Mr. Jackson's elephants. The children, Mr. Mesereau said, were out of control.</p>
        <p>He also denied accusations that Mr. Jackson had shown the children pornographic magazines, saying that they found them on their own and that Mr. Jackson snatched the magazines away and locked them up.</p>
        <p>And he said that investigators did not find any DNA from the accuser in Mr. Jackson's bedroom, where prosecutors say he molested the boy.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Mesereau finished his presentation, the prosecution showed the jury the two-hour documentary, ''Living With Michael Jackson.''</p>
        <p>The program includes scenes of the accuser with Mr. Jackson and Mr. Jackson defending his practice of sharing his bed with children. The documentary touched off panic in the Jackson camp because of the admissions about sleeping with children, prosecutors said, and led to a conspiracy to imprison and silence the accuser's family.</p>
        <p>At one point during the showing of the documentary, when Mr. Jackson was talking about his love for children, the singer appeared to dab at his eyes with a tissue. At another point, when archival footage of him performing with the Jackson 5 as a young boy appeared on the screen, his mother, Katherine, smiled, and his older brother Jackie, nodded his head along with the music.</p>
        <p>The prosecution's first witness was the British journalist who made the Jackson documentary, Martin Bashir.</p>
        <p>The chief prosecutor, District Attorney Thomas W. Sneddon Jr. of Santa Barbara County, asked Mr. Bashir a few questions about his background and qualifications before the tape was shown.</p>
        <p>But at the conclusion, Mr. Bashir came under hostile cross-examination from Mr. Mesereau, who sought to have the documentary and most of Mr. Bashir's testimony stricken from the record because Mr. Bashir refused to answer questions about how he obtained Mr. Jackson's cooperation in the project. His questions suggested that Mr. Bashir had misrepresented himself and tricked Mr. Jackson into participating.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bashir's lawyer, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., objected repeatedly to Mr. Mesereau's questions, saying that journalists do not have to testify about unpublished material, citing both California's journalist shield law and the First Amendment. The judge in the case, Rodney S. Melville of Santa Barbara County Superior Court, instructed Mr. Bashir to answer. He refused.</p>
        <p>Judge Melville said he and the lawyers had waded into a ''really ticklish area of the law'' and said he would rule later on what legal protections might apply to Mr. Bashir.</p>
        <p>As he left the courtroom, Mr. Jackson was asked how he felt. ''Good,'' he replied, then turned a moment later to say, ''Angry.''</p>
