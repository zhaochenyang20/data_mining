        <p>LEAD: The adjectives used to describe today's Boston Celtic-Detroit Piston game weren't the ones usually heard in locker rooms after playoff games.</p>

        <p>LEAD: The adjectives used to describe today's Boston Celtic-Detroit Piston game weren't the ones usually heard in locker rooms after playoff games.</p>
        <p>The adjectives used to describe today's Boston Celtic-Detroit Piston game weren't the ones usually heard in locker rooms after playoff games.</p>
        <p>''Bizarre, crazy,'' said Kevin McHale, the Celtics' power forward.</p>
        <p>''Weird,'' said Chuck Daly, the Pistons' coach.</p>
        <p>''Most unusual,'' Jimmy Rodgers, the Celtics' assistant coach, said of the game that the Celtics won, 79-78, on a Dennis Johnson free throw with 8 seconds left to tie the four-of-seven- game series at 2-2.</p>
        <p>It might have been easier to say it belonged among the worst played games in National Basketball Association history.</p>
        <p>And there were plenty of statistics and odd happenings in the 2-hour-26- minute game to support that claim.</p>
        <p>To begin with, the Pistons, leading by 8-4 the first quarter, missed their next 20 shots before Dennis Rodman scored on a driving layup 10 minutes 11 seconds later.</p>
        <p>The combined 26 points in the opening quarter by both teams - 10 by Detroit and 16 by Boston - was the lowest total in a playoff quarter since the Chicago Bulls (13) and the Pistons (17) combined for 30 points on April 5, 1974.</p>
        <p>Not only did the Pistons set a club low in the first quarter, they matched it in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>The Pistons shot only .167 for the first quarter, .288 for the half and .333 for the game. The Celtics tossed in a 14-point third quarter in which they shot .214, Boston shot .400 for the game.</p>
        <p>Among the strange events were Adrian Dantley trying to inbound the ball to John Salley for an alley-oop only to have his pass go through the basket. Since the ball came from out of bounds it didn't count.</p>
        <p>There were consecutive air balls seconds apart by Bill Laimbeer, who led the Pistons with 29 points, and Larry Bird, who had 20 to lead the Celtics.</p>
        <p>Bird was called for a technical foul, a rarity, when he complained about being charged with a fourth foul with 6:41 left in the third quarter. He spent the rest of the period on the bench.</p>
        <p>And there was the controversial finish.</p>
        <p>After Johnson made one of two free throws to put the Celtics ahead by 79-78, the Pistons called timeout. When the huddle broke, Isiah Thomas threw the inbounds pass to Laimbeer, who passed up an open shot from the top of the key and got the ball instead to Joe Dumars. The Piston guard, the hero of Game 3 with 29 points but who had made only one of nine shots to that point, fired up a 10-foot jumper. Some thought the ball fell short before it was grabbed by Robert Parish. Others thought it was goaltending.  ''I don't know,'' said Daly, obviously disturbed by his team's play, ''I'm not in the officiating business.''</p>
        <p>Ed Rush, one of the two officials, said: ''The prerequisite for goaltending is that the ball has to have a chance to go into the basket. The defensive player, Robert Parish, pulled the ball straight down. As he did, the ball ticked the front of the rim.''</p>
        <p>''So was it goaltending?'' he was asked again.</p>
        <p>''It was short,'' Rush said. ''The ball was clearly outside the rim. It would not have gone into the basket, therefore it was definitely not goaltending.''</p>
        <p>The victory that restored the homecourt advantage to the Celtics, broke a nine-game Boston losing streak at the Silverdome. The Pistons now must win a game at Boston Garden, where they have lost 21 of their last 22 games, to win the series. The one victory, however, was last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''It was a defensive struggle to say the best,'' said Daly, ''It was game in which both teams struggled to score, probably because of the intensity of both teams. What hurts most is that they got a split here and that's what they were here to do. Now we start over with a three-game series.''</p>
        <p>Bird, who has been shooting badly in the series (.351 going into the game), had one short span when he looked like the Bird of old when a game is on the line. He scored 7 points in 84 seconds at the start of the fourth quarter on three straight jumpers, including a 3-pointer, to slice the Piston lead to 68-67.</p>
        <p>''I felt good after the rest,'' Bird said. ''I felt like starting the game over, rather than finishing it.''</p>
        <p>Bird was also critical of Laimbeer for passing up the final shot of the game and passing the ball to Dumars.</p>
        <p>''I guarantee you I would have taken that shot,'' Bird said. ''I would have taken the shot even if I would have missed 300 of them. He even surprised Dumars by passing it to him.'' ----Daly's Contract to End Under an unusal expiration date, negotiated two years ago, Daly's coaching contract with the Pistons will end Tuesday night. ''I guess they didn't think this would go this far,'' the Piston coach said. ''I guess they will continue to pay at the same rate I have been getting.''</p>
        <p>Daly and the Pistons have been at odds over a new contract for some time. ''They just won't come to an agreement,'' he said before the game. Daly said his average salary for the five seasons he has coached the Pistons was $185,000.</p>
        <p>Jack McCloskey, the general manager, said: ''Chuck has a very lucrative contract in his pocket when he is ready to sign it. His agent wants to wait until after the playoffs.''</p>
