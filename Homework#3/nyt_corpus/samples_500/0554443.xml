        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>There is no difference in the way a hurricane destroys a rich person's home and a poor person's home. Unfortunately in this country there is still a big difference in the opportunities each will have to rebuild that home and a stable life.</p>
        <p>The second tragedy of Hurricane Andrew is that when the emergency is over and the long-term recovery gets under way, many of those who lost their homes so swiftly, those with no insurance, no savings and no health care, will find themselves abandoned by a system that provides little opportunity to re-enter the mainstream.</p>
        <p>These people will suddenly face a reality well known to millions of other low-income Americans, a reality in which years of inattention to long-term solutions has made it nearly impossible for the poorest sector of society to attain basic necessities such as affordable housing, social services and health care, especially during a crisis.</p>
        <p>Emergency relief is essential but will go only so far toward rebuilding lives. After that, people will have to rely on the established systems; and they will find that the next crisis they face, unlike the randomness of a hurricane, is merely symptomatic of our country's failure to address the long-term needs of low-income citizens.</p>
        <p>At this point they may stop wondering at the blameless tragedy of the storm and start wondering why, for example, Congress has still failed to renew a widely praised, proven tool like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. The tax credit is the catalyst of over 95 percent of the nation's affordable housing production, yet Congress recessed without renewing it for next year.</p>
        <p>It's time to start thinking in the long term -- to recognize the necessity of programs like the tax credit and make them permanent. Let's respond to emergencies quickly and well, but be certain that we also have long-term systems in place that will prevent, not solidify, the disaster of a permanent underclass in our society. ANDREW HEISKELL New York, Aug. 31, 1992</p>
        <p>The writer is co-chairman of the New York City Advisory Board of the Enterprise Foundation.</p>
