        <p>LEAD: President Bush said today that the changes transforming Eastern Europe are ''absolutely amazing,'' and credited the Soviet Union with making those changes possible.</p>
        <p>President Bush said today that the changes transforming Eastern Europe are ''absolutely amazing,'' and credited the Soviet Union with making those changes possible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's buoyant reflections on his five-day trip to Poland and Hungary were a far cry from the tart skepticism he maintained toward President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and changes in Eastern Europe during his campaign and the opening months of his Administration.</p>
        <p>''I am firmly convinced that this wave of freedom, if you will, is the wave of the future,'' President Bush said, as he flew on Air Force One from Budapest to Paris today to attend the economic summit and the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. ''And I would expect that this visit has been watched by the people of other Eastern European countries and hopefully given encouragement to those who want to go to the path of reform.'' 'Right From the Heart'</p>
        <p>He said he had been surprised at ''the feeling and emotion of it all,'' and said the meetings were not ''your traditional 'I'll read my cards and you read your cards' kind of diplomacy.''</p>
        <p>Communist and opposition leaders ''spoke right from the heart'' to him, he said, and he tried to respond in kind.</p>
        <p>''It was very special in that regard,'' he said. ''There's an intensity to it, a fervor, that moved me very much.''</p>
        <p>Of his meetings with the Communist leaders in Poland and Hungary, Mr. Bush said: ''I made very clear to them that, you know, we are not there to poke a stick in the eye of Mr. Gorbachev -just the opposite, to encourage the very kind of reforms that he is championing, and more reforms.''</p>
        <p>Asked if it was Mr. Gorbachev's approach to East-West relations that has given people in Eastern Europe the license to make changes, Mr. Bush agreed and said he wanted to ''repeat for the umpteenth time'' that he wants to see perestroika succeed.</p>
        <p>''I think without the change in the Soviet Union it would have been highly unlikely that Eastern Europe would be achieving the kinds of changes that it is aspiring to,'' he said. Aims to Please Soviet Leader</p>
        <p>Although some critics felt that Mr. Bush had been too cautious and low-key in his appeals to democracy, as a sop to Mr. Gorbachev, the President made it clear that he wanted the Soviet leader to be pleased with his trip rather than irritated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who once insisted it was important not to take a romantic view of the Soviet leader, said today that he intended to have regular meetings with Mr. Gorbachev.</p>
        <p>He rejected suggestions that the United States was dragging its feet on arms control as ''pure nonsense,'' and said he does not listen when Soviet spokesmen say the Soviets cannot meet the reduction timetables on Mr. Bush's conventional arms proposal. ''I don't think Gorbachev wants to slow down an agreement on conventional arms,'' the President said. ''I think he wants to move forward there and on the strategic arms talks, and so do we.''</p>
        <p>The President said he was particularly struck by how emotional his meetings with Hungarian leaders were, and by the warmth of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish leader. Mr. Bush said the general ''is really out front in the reforms,'' Reaffirms Policy on Israel</p>
        <p>The President also reaffirmed the Administration's policy on Israel and the future of the occupied territories.</p>
        <p>''We might as well be frank with our friends, because that's what friendship is about,'' he said. ''And so I want to see things go forward in terms of the peace process over there. And we want to see the election process go forward. And if anybody can make a case for me that the recent deliberations in that party will enhance the election process, then I'd say, great,'' the President said.</p>
        <p>He was referring to the Likud Party's decision last week to attach strict conditions to Prime Minister Yizhak Shamir's plan for elections among Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Some members of the Labor Party and many Palestinians say the conditions would kill the proposal for elections in the occupied territories.</p>
        <p>''But I'm afraid other people are looking at it saying what's happened does not enhance the possibilities of election. So the U.S. policy is set, and I'm the President of the United States, and Israel is a friend and will remain a friend, but I have to say what our policy is.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he was under pressure about his Israel policy, the President replied: ''They've got great difficulties inside of Israel. I understand that. I understand the political pressures. But I can't be varying U.S. policy every day to accommodate political change. I'm not going to do that.''</p>
        <p>Before the Bushes left Budapest, he stopped to place flowers at the Raoul Wallenberg Memorial, dedicated to the Swedish diplomat who helped Jews escape Nazis during the war. Thousands of people lined the route from the memorial to the airport.</p>
        <p>When the President arrived in Paris, he went to a lunch at which President Francois Mitterrand was the host. He sat between Mr. Mitterrand and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.</p>
        <p>After lunch the President met privately with President Mitterrand in an ornate gilded room at the palace.</p>
        <p>General Scowcroft said afterward that the two leaders spent most of their time talking about President Bush's trip to Hungary and to Poland, which Mr. Mitterrand visited recently.</p>
