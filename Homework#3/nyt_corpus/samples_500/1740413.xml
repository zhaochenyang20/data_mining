        <p>An article on Wednesday about questions raised by doctors' statements on Vice President Dick Cheney's hunting accident gave an incorrect figure from one of them for the size of birdshot pellets lodged in the body of the victim, Harry M. Whittington. They are 0.095 inches in diameter, or 2.4 millimeters, as shown in an illustration with the article -- not about 5 millimeters.</p>
        <p>Because of errors in a news conference transcription by The Times, the article also gave incorrect titles for an executive at Christus Spohn Hospital in Corpus Christi, Tex., where Mr. Whittington is recovering. The executive, Peter Banko, is vice president/administrator, not medical director of the emergency department, and he is not a doctor.</p>
