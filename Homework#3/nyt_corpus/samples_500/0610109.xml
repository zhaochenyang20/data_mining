        <p>Mitsuhiro Kotani, a corporate raider whose shadowy stock market maneuvers in the 1980's toppled major politicians, bankers and businessmen in a web of illicit activities, was handed a light suspended sentence today after being convicted of a multimillion-dollar stock manipulation scheme.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kotani has become a symbol of the excesses of what was known here as the bubble era, a period when stock and real estate prices rose to exaggerated levels before collapsing during the 1990's</p>
        <p>He rose to a dominant position in the market in the late 1980's. He was often pictured in popular publications with business and political leaders, and boasted that he could raise millions of dollars with a few phone calls.</p>
        <p>He operated through the Koshin group, a loose assemblage of wealthy individuals and companies. It staged Japan's first and last hostile takeover, of an aerial surveying company called Kokusai Kogyo, in 1988.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kotani's downfall was swift. After the stock market began to collapse in 1990, his empire unraveled, and with it his links to the financiers and power brokers. Government officials have characterized his activities as an aberration, but his ties to the establishment were deep and broad, as suggested by the list of billionaires, Government ministers and bankers that he brought down. Faced Two Indictments</p>
        <p>Mr. Kotani has faced two indictments. In one, in which he was found guilty, he was charged with having worked secretly with a group of investors to force up illegally the price of shares in Fujita Tourist Enterprises, a resort group. The manipulation produced millions of dollars in profits for the members of the group. Mr. Kotani was sentenced today to an 18-month suspended sentence, and is unlikely to spend any time in prison.</p>
        <p>In handing down what was widely regarded as a modest sentence, Shigeru Matsuura, the chief judge, said, "Please control yourself. You were a spoiled child of the era." It was the first time the Government had applied a law against stock manipulation.</p>
        <p>Shuichi Yamamoto, the former head of a construction company, was convicted in the scheme and received a four-month suspended sentence.</p>
        <p>In the other indictment, Mr. Kotani was charged with extorting 30 billion yen from the Janome Sewing Machine Company, the shares of which he also reportedly manipulated. Mr. Kotani was accused of having acquired a stake in the company, then threatened to sell the shares to gangsters unless the company bought back the shares at above-market prices.</p>
        <p>The company arranged for payments and loans of several hundred million dollars. Mr. Kotani has denied the charges and the case is pending. Powerful Figures Involved</p>
        <p>Mr. Kotani is accused of heading the Fujita manipulation scheme and the Janome extortion to pay off debts from the takeover of Kokusai Kogyo.</p>
        <p>The list of the powerful figures implicated by Mr. Kotani is long. Toshiyuki Inamura, a former minister for environmental protection, was found guilty of having evaded taxes on more than $25 million he earned from trading in shares using insider tips provided by Mr. Kotani.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kotani's personal physician, Dr. Akiyuki Yamaguchi, pleaded guilty to charges that he failed to pay about 830 million yen in taxes on earnings from stock dealings that relied on information from Mr. Kotani.</p>
        <p>Hirotomo Takei, one of Japan's wealthiest men, was found guilty of having concealed from the tax authorities 4.3 billion yen in income, most of it earned from trading in shares using inside information provided by Mr. Kotani.</p>
        <p>Ichiro Isoda was forced to resign as the chairman of the Sumitomo Bank, a huge bank, in part because of disclosures that the bank's executives had arranged $175 million in illegal loans to Mr. Kotani.</p>
        <p>Takeo Masuno was forced to resign as the president of Kyowa Saitama Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the world, after it was disclosed that the bank had financed what it knew was an extortion scheme by Mr. Kotani against Janome Sewing Machine.</p>
