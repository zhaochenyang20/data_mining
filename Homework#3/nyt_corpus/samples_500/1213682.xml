        <p>Until recently, Robert Nyantika, 30, was a strong, straight-backed police officer fighting ''shifters'' -- guerrillas and cattle thieves who make cross-border raids from Somalia. Now he is a stooped wraith unable to focus his eyes, bathe himself or walk without help. Speaking in a voice somewhere between a whisper and a song, he says his best memory is that his unit never left its wounded behind.</p>
        <p>His elder brother, Omari, has the same philosophy. When he heard that Robert was deathly ill in a faraway clinic, he brought him home, already gravely thin from AIDS-related tuberculosis and diarrhea. Overworked doctors at a public Nairobi hospital were too busy or indifferent to examine Robert for a week, but Omari, a home health worker in a Nairobi slum, realized what was happening: Robert had the crippling headaches and stiff neck of cryptococcal meningitis, an AIDS complication that would blind and then kill him within two weeks.</p>
        <p>The cure is fluconazole, a drug patented in most of the world by Pfizer, Inc. and commonly prescribed in America as a one-pill cure for women's yeast infections.</p>
        <p>In Kenya, it costs $18 per pill, a price paid by the tiny number who can afford Nairobi's one private hospital and escape the vagaries of a national health budget that averages $5 per citizen per year. To live, Robert would need two pills a day for 8 weeks -- cost $1,080 -- and then one a day for the rest of his life -- $540 a month. His monthly earnings as a police officer were $43.</p>
        <p>Robert's cure became a tiny part of the titanic struggle going on between pharmaceutical companies and public health advocates over the cost of drugs like fluconazole and who has the right to produce and market them.</p>
        <p>A cheaper generic version of the drug was available and made legally in Thailand, which along with South Africa has challenged the drug companies' monopoly on their most successful products. This, they say, is the only way to save lives from the AIDS epidemic. The Thai generic, which costs only 60 cents a pill, could not be brought legally to Kenya, which like many other third world countries is only now considering whether to follow the Thai and South African challenge to the world's pharmaceutical giants.</p>
        <p>But Omari knew a nurse at a foreign aid agency where doctors furious at Pfizer's pricing policy were illegally smuggling the Thai drug into Kenya. They had enough to save two lives. Robert's became one.</p>
        <p>In April, when Robert began taking the pills, he was too weak to lift his hand to his mouth, but he still had courage, Omari said.</p>
        <p>''He recognizes how expensive the drugs are, and if he vomits, he throws that away,'' Omari said. ''So he really clings on. He fights to contain them.''</p>
        <p>By mid-June, Robert was alive and home in this Nairobi suburb where goats graze beside row houses and turkeys stalk up and down the dirt roads. He had survived a bout of malaria and was still skeletal, but he could feed himself, sit up and walk with help. Asked where he most wanted to go, he answered: ''Back to my place of work.'' Omari, who still helps bathe him, is slowly breaking it to Robert that this is unlikely. He is proud that his care, connections and good luck have bought his brother a few more months, perhaps even a few more years of life.</p>
        <p>Setting Prices  Big Differences And Big Profits</p>
        <p>Fluconazole, the best anti-fungal agent invented by modern science, is equally effective against toenail fungus, children's oral thrush and cryptococcal meningitis. It is too miraculous for the poor to live without and too profitable for Pfizer to give up.</p>
        <p>Two competing forces have intensified the battle over drugs like fluconazole: the 1994 world treaty on intellectual property that underpins free trade and the AIDS epidemic of the 1990's, which is devastating whole continents too poor to pay the going rate for patented drugs.</p>
        <p>The public health advocates and an increasing number of third world countries say the 1994 treaty allows them to manufacture or import much cheaper generic drugs to avert national disaster; the drug companies argue that the costs of developing drugs are so high that they cannot afford lower prices for the few that become wildly successful.</p>
        <p>Pfizer first patented fluconazole in 1982 under the name Diflucan, and it will remain patented until 2004 in the United States and longer elsewhere. It is one of many drugs that put the drug companies in an awkward position: They earn their largest profits when they are prescribed for routine problems of wealthy Americans and Europeans, but they could save millions of the very poor if available and affordable.</p>
        <p>To protect valuable patents, the industry has used a whole array of tactics, from aggressive lobbying to generous giveaways of millions of doses.</p>
        <p>Cryptococcal meningitis attacks about 9 percent of all people with AIDS. In some countries, like Thailand, it attacks more than 20 percent. Untreated, the victims die in less than a month.</p>
        <p>The wholesale prices of pills are set to recoup the costs of research, which the industry says is about $500 million per new drug, to pay for marketing, lobbying and other overhead, and to earn the huge returns that make the pharmaceutical industry among the world's most profitable.</p>
        <p>Pfizer sells roughly $1 billion worth of fluconazole a year.</p>
        <p>Its wholesale prices vary widely around the globe. A 1999 study by the Nobel Prize-winning agency Doctors Without Borders found them ranging from $3.60 a pill in Thailand to over $27 in Guatemala, with about a $10 average. Pfizer did not dispute the average, but said the range is smaller, from $5 in Thailand to $11 in France. The wholesale price is $6.38 in South Africa, $8.52 in Kenya and $9.78 in the United States. With retail markups, the drug may sell for $40 a pill.</p>
        <p>In countries that do not honor American patents, the same drug is made by generics manufacturers. Cipla, a major Indian drug company, offers it for 64 cents a pill; Madawa Pharmaceuticals of Bangladesh for 41 cents, three Thai companies for between 30 and 70 cents.</p>
        <p>Pfizer has other phenomenally profitable drugs: Lipitor, which cuts cholesterol, Zoloft for depression and, of course, Viagra. Because it is so wealthy, and yet keeps fluconazole prices high, Pfizer's critics call it a pitiless corporation that lets people die rather than cut prices or relinquish patents.</p>
        <p>''Everyone -- senior citizens, AIDS activists -- always accuses us of being profiteers,'' said Brian McGlynn, chief spokesman for Pfizer. ''And they say we'd rather give a rich white guy an erection than help an African with AIDS.</p>
        <p>''But we invest $4.7 billion in research each year, and 3 out of 10 medicines never make back their investment. And, yes, we spend a lot of money on advertising and marketing. But we don't sell soda pop. It's an enormous transfer of knowledge from our lab scientists to doctors, through those sales reps.''</p>
        <p>South Africa has the world's fastest-growing AIDS epidemic. In April, on the day that AIDS activists, unions and religious groups were set to begin a lawsuit and picketing campaign denouncing the company as an AIDS profiteer, Pfizer announced that it would supply the drug free to any South African with AIDS who could not afford it.</p>
        <p>If the company expected thanks, it got almost none.</p>
        <p>Act Up, the American AIDS activism group, tried to storm Pfizer's annual meeting. By June, Doctors Without Borders, which is campaigning for cheaper drugs, was accusing Pfizer of reneging on its promise. It said the company had imposed a time limit on its donation and required doctors to report back as if in a clinical trial.</p>
        <p>Seeking Solutions  As Disease Spreads, More Nations Act</p>
        <p>Pfizer denied this, saying the company will supply the drug free for life to every South African whose doctor says he cannot afford it, and that doctors have to report only whether their patients still take the pills and are still alive. The first free pills will not be distributed before fall at the earliest.</p>
        <p>In Kenya, at a meeting in June on drug prices, officials from several African countries wondered aloud why they could not get the same deal. Dr. Jack Watters, Pfizer's medical director for Africa, said the giveaway might eventually be extended to the rest of Africa. He had already spoken with the Kenyan health authorities, he said.</p>
        <p>''If we can make it a success anywhere, we can in South Africa, because they have the best infrastructure,'' he said. Asked what the company's limit for charity was, he said, ''I really don't know the answer.</p>
        <p>''I tell the C.E.O.: 'We have 100,000 patients, they need 200 milligram pills, we don't know how long they'll live . . .' It's impossible math to do. We're not planning to stop the program, we're planning to look at it after two years.''</p>
        <p>The profits on fluconazole and other drugs allow Pfizer to give away $120 million worth of free drugs a year, including millions of free doses of its best-selling antibiotic, Zithromax, to cure eye infections in central Africa and to treat venereal disease among southern African prostitutes and mineworkers, who are central to the spread of AIDS.</p>
        <p>However, many third world countries believe they cannot wait until the big pharmaceutical companies grant them charity.</p>
        <p>At the June conference here, held some weeks after he had spoken to Dr. Watters, Kenya's health minister, Amukowa Anangwe, attacked profiteering, referring specifically to fluconazole. He said afterward that Kenya's Parliament was ready to pass a law allowing him to declare a health emergency when an important drug is unavailable at reasonable prices. The bill would empower him to void the drug's patent in Kenya. He could then either import cheap generic versions or use the threat to get Pfizer to lower its price.</p>
        <p>More and more countries are contemplating or pursuing this path, taken already by South Africa and Thailand.</p>
        <p>Until the 1990's, Thai law did not allow medicines to be patented. But the country signed the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which covers all sorts of goods. Signers become members of the World Trade Organization, an important goal for Thailand, which depends heavily on exports.</p>
        <p>But one million Thais are infected with the AIDS virus, and high-priced medicines, fluconazole included, were eating up the health budget. The intellectual property laws Thailand generally defended started working against life expectancy.</p>
        <p>Setting U.S. Role  Once Firms' Protector But Changing Course</p>
        <p>Because fluconazole was on the market before the law changed, it was unpatentable. But under American pressure, Thailand had created a program that conferred the same market exclusivity. Pfizer put fluconazole in it and charged $7 a capsule. When the exclusivity expired in 1998, three Thai companies began to make cheap generic fluconazole. Pfizer promptly dropped its price sharply in Thailand. Thai law allows the health minister to declare an emergency and seize a drug patent. In patent law, it is known as ''compulsory licensing'' -- a company is compelled to license its secrets to a rival.</p>
        <p>In practice, Dr. Korn Dabbarensi, Thailand's health minister, said in an interview, seizing a patent is usually too much legal bother; the mere threat normally gets a company to lower its prices.</p>
        <p>''Even though we're able to go ahead with compulsory licensing, we've been informed by the Ministry of Trade that we have to use W.T.O. procedures,'' Dr. Dabbarensi said. ''So we go talk directly to the drug companies in a 'humane' manner. Just one-to-one talking. But the bottom line for me is -- how 'humane' are these manufacturers? They are talking to me about the profits of their company against the lives of my people.''</p>
        <p>The 1994 global trade treaty specifically permits governments to use compulsory licensing -- not just for drugs, but for any safeguards against crises in public safety, war, health or environmental disasters. Such exceptions apply only to cure domestic emergency, and some royalty must be paid to the patent holder.</p>
        <p>The Western pharmaceutical industry opposes compulsory licensing, and another practice known as ''parallel importing,'' which let a country's drug buyers seek the cheapest price anywhere in the world. Until recently, the drug companies' most powerful ally was the United States government.</p>
        <p>The United States is a signatory to the 1994 protection of copyright worldwide, and has pressed other countries to pass patent and copyright laws more restrictive than its own to protect American corporations against foreign piracy.</p>
        <p>In 1997, when South Africa tried to pass a law allowing the health minister to ignore the Patents Act in health crises, the United States lobbied hard against it. President Clinton raised the issue with President Nelson Mandela, the Commerce Department put South Africa on a watch list that is the first step toward trade sanctions, and a bill went through Congress making all American aid to South Africa contingent on dropping the law.</p>
        <p>The South African pharmaceutical industry, which included subsidiaries of American and European companies, took the pressure much further. It closed factories, canceled investments and took out scare ads suggesting that babies could be hurt by counterfeit generic drugs. Its chief lobbyist, Mirryena Deeb, threatened to cut off all new drug discoveries to South Africa if the law passed, including AIDS drugs, cancer drugs and antibiotics. Asked in a March 1998 interview if she was literally threatening to let thousands of South Africans die, she reluctantly conceded: ''In so many words, yes.''</p>
        <p>The practices that the United States and the industry were fighting so hard were legal not only under the 1994 treaty, but also under the laws of Western countries like France and Britain.</p>
        <p>The United States, too, is a big user of compulsory licensing, said Carlos M. Correa, an internationally recognized patent law expert with the University of Buenos Aires. It is a common remedy in antitrust cases and  was recently considered in the Microsoft case (it would have forced the company to license its Windows source code to rivals).</p>
        <p>America's change of course came rather abruptly last year.</p>
        <p>In early 1999, the Clinton administration was still squarely against South Africa's Medicines Control Act.</p>
        <p>By December, the administration said it would not object if South Africa violated American law in seeking AIDS medications, as long as it abided by World Trade Organization rules. Within months, it had offered the same olive branch to the rest of Africa and to Thailand.</p>
        <p>The catalyst was, apparently, a decision by the Philadelphia branch of Act Up, the gay advocacy group, to take up South Africa's cause and start heckling Vice President Al Gore, who was in the midst of his primary campaign for the presidency. The banners saying that Mr. Gore was letting Africans die to please American pharmaceutical companies left his campaign chagrined. After media and campaign staff looked into the matter, the administration did an about-face.</p>
        <p>Without cheaper drugs, public health advocates say, the problems of doctors like Christopher Ouma, who works in a Nairobi public hospital where nearly 70 percent of patients have AIDS, will never be solved.</p>
        <p>He recently listed drugs his hospital can never afford in sufficient quantity: Vitamins. Morphine. Warfarin for blood clots in the bedridden. Acyclovir for blinding shingles. Any anti-retrovirals, including the oldest, AZT. And, of course, fluconazole.</p>
        <p>The chief killers of his AIDS patients, he said, are tuberculosis, diarrhea, pneumonia and cryptococcal meningitis. The first three are usually treatable. With the last, he said, ''we run up against a wall'' because of the price of fluconazole.</p>
        <p>These patients are instantly recognizable, he says, because they moan all day. No painkiller but morphine works for them, and it is rationed.</p>
        <p>''They get no peace,'' Dr. Ouma said. ''With the intense pressure on the brain, some go blind. Most just go into a coma and die, and by then they are in such pain that it's really a blessing.''</p>
        <p>As soon as he diagnoses cryptococcal meningitis in a patient, he says, he dispenses advice he hates: If they want to be buried in their ancestral village, as most Kenyans do, they should board a bus. They have only two or three weeks to live, and the cost of refrigerated trucks ruins many families.</p>
        <p>''Can you imagine, as a doctor, having this conversation with your patient?'' he said. ''I have it once a week.''</p>
