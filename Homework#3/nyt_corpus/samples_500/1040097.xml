        <p>ZUCCHINI is the vegetable that doesn't know when to stop. A backyard zucchini crop at this time of year can grow from merely abundant to brazen, overtaking the garden and leaving the gardener with more zucchini than anyone could ever need.</p>
        <p>But it is not necessary to resort to sneaking out in the dead of night and leaving baskets of the stuff anonymously on an unwary neighbor's doorstep. This is a problem that calls for a creative solution, and that solution is called soup.</p>
        <p>As I have been working with soups lately, I have found that there are many pleasant alternatives to stock for the base, and some of these take advantage of produce that is abundant right now. Bases made from watery vegetables, like tomatoes, cucumber and zucchini, have fresh, attractive flavors, along with the added benefit of making our vegetarian friends very happy. These bases can be made now when the vegetables are plentiful and inexpensive, and they can then be frozen, if desired.</p>
        <p>Making the zucchini puree soup base requires a minimal amount of cooking on a hot, late summer day: just saute the zucchini until it is tender, and then puree it.</p>
        <p>Made with unpeeled zucchini, the puree and the soups it is added to will have more color and intense flavor, with a slight, pleasant hint of bitterness. Made with peeled zucchini, the base and soups will be paler and milder.</p>
        <p>Somewhere between a salad and a soup is zucchini gazpacho, cool and refreshing. For the fullest flavor, chill the gazpacho overnight, and then add strips of another summer favorite, basil, on top just before serving it.</p>
        <p>Chilled zucchini and parsley soup is ridiculously easy to make and low in calories. Vegetarians should note, however, that this recipe does use chicken stock, which gives the soup a fuller flavor. Low-fat cottage cheese adds just a bit of creamy texture to the soup, and hot pepper sauce provides some zip.</p>
        <p>And though no one wants to think of winter right now, keep the zucchini puree in mind as the base for heartier cold-weather soups in the months to come. Two of my favorites are a soothing cabbage soup and a minestrone that warms the soul.</p>
        <p>By the time I make these soups, concerns about an overflowing zucchini garden will be long gone, and the vegetable's aroma will conjure up only pleasant memories of these summer days.</p>
        <p>ZUCCHINI PUREE SOUP BASE  Time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons butter or olive oil (see note)</p>
        <p>3 pounds medium zucchini, peeled or unpeeled, quartered lengthwise and cut across into  1/2-inch pieces.</p>
        <p>1. In medium stockpot, heat butter or oil over medium heat until bubbling. Stir in the zucchini. Lower heat, and cover pot. Cook zucchini, stirring frequently, for 45 minutes or until very tender.</p>
        <p>2. Remove from heat, and cool slightly. Pass through fine disk of food mill, or puree in food processor.</p>
        <p>3. Use immediately, refrigerate for as long as 3 days, or freeze.</p>
        <p>Yield: 3 3/4 cups.</p>
        <p>Note: If making zucchini gazpacho, make soup base with olive oil, not butter.</p>
        <p>ZUCCHINI GAZPACHO  Time: 15 minutes, plus overnight chilling</p>
        <p>3 3/4 cups zucchini puree soup base made with olive oil, chilled</p>
        <p>1 medium red bell pepper, seeded, de-ribbed and cut into  1/4-inch dice</p>
        <p>2 small tomatoes, seeded and cut into  1/4-inch dice</p>
        <p>1 medium rib celery, peeled and cut into  1/4-inch dice</p>
        <p>1/2 cup coarsely chopped basil, plus 4 large leaves cut across in narrow strips</p>
        <p>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
        <p>4 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon lemon juice.</p>
        <p>Combine zucchini puree with rest of ingredients, except thinly sliced basil leaves and lemon juice. Refrigerate overnight. When ready to serve, add lemon juice. Top each bowl of gazpacho with a little of the sliced basil leaves.</p>
        <p>Yield: 5 cups; 4 servings.</p>
        <p>CHILLED ZUCCHINI AND PARSLEY SOUP  Time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>4 cups chicken stock</p>
        <p>2 cups zucchini puree soup base</p>
        <p>1 medium bunch Italian parsley, leaves only</p>
        <p>1/2 cup low-fat cottage cheese</p>
        <p>Few drops hot red-pepper sauce</p>
        <p>Kosher salt, to taste</p>
        <p>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste.</p>
        <p>1. In medium saucepan, bring chicken stock to boil. Add zucchini puree, and return to boil. Stir in parsley, and cook just until it wilts. Strain, and reserve liquid and solids separately.</p>
        <p>2. In blender, working in batches of no more than 2 cups, puree solids with cottage cheese and a little of the liquid.</p>
        <p>3. Stir in remaining liquid, and season to taste with hot red-pepper sauce, salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 cups; 6 servings.</p>
