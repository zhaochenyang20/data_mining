        <p>Fund-raising results released yesterday by the four major Democratic candidates to succeed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani showed that each  appeared to be accumulating war chests that would allow them to spend the most allowed under city election rules.</p>
        <p>With the Democratic primary for the mayoral race 14 months away, each of the four candidates has raised at least $2.8 million in total contributions, according to the filings, which are required by the city's Campaign Finance Board to qualify for public matching funds. Although the deadline for the filings is Monday afternoon, aides to each of the candidates said they had prepared figures yesterday.</p>
        <p>Coming after more than two years of aggressive fund-raising by all the candidates, the figures may have been disappointing for supporters of the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone. He reported raising $625,000 during the six months that ended July 11, less than half the $1.4 million he raised in the six months that ended in January. Mr. Vallone has raised a total of $2.8 million, and has $2.1 million left on hand.</p>
        <p>''During this calendar year, the business of government has taken up a lot of the speaker's time, and he has not been able to spend every minute dialing for dollars,'' said Adam Macy, a spokesman for Mr. Vallone's campaign. But, Mr. Macy said, ''people will start focusing on this race after the Senate race,'' and each of the four leading Democrats will have ''plenty of money.''</p>
        <p>The city comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, raised the most during the reporting period: $1.4 million, bringing his total donations to $4.9 million, according to approximate figures provided by his media consultant, Hank Morris. Mr. Hevesi has $4.6 million on hand, Mr. Morris said.</p>
        <p>A close second in fund-raising over the last six months was Mark Green, the public advocate, who reported raising $1.1 million during the period.  That amount, described in a press release by his campaign staff as ''exceeding our most optimistic estimates,'' raised Mr. Green's total contributions to $3.3 million, with $2.9 million on hand.</p>
        <p>Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, raised $850,240 during the reporting period, bringing his total to $2.9 million, with $2.4 million on hand, said Allen Cappelli, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cappelli said that he expected all four of the leading Democrats to raise enough to fully qualify for matching campaign funds by the end of December.</p>
        <p>The only other Democrat who has filed for the mayoral race and is seeking public matching funds, a former city councilman, Sal Albanese of Brooklyn, said yesterday that he raised $90,000 during the last six months, bringing his total to $265,000.</p>
        <p>Thus far, no major Republican mayoral candidate has emerged.</p>
        <p>Under the city's new campaign finance law, $1,000 in public matching campaign funds is provided to the candidates for each $250 contributed to their campaigns by individual New Yorkers, up to a limit of 55 percent of their total spending.</p>
        <p>The law, which bans corporate contributions, sets a limit of $4,500 for individual contributions and caps total spending by each candidate on the mayoral primary at $5.5 million.</p>
