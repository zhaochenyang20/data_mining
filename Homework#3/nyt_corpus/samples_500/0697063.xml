        <p>The oversize Pirelli P Zero tires shudder a warning before breaking loose from the wet pavement. But my reaction is a few tenths of a second slow. The $130,000 sports car spins out of control with a screech despite my desperate efforts to countersteer to the right.</p>
        <p>"No problem -- much better than last time," soothes my passenger and instructor, Gianni, a master of euphemism and good cheer. Habits formed from decades of driving cars as spongy as department-store Santas, we agree, cannot be changed overnight. Besides, neither we nor the 320-horsepower Ferrari 348 TB was in any real danger.</p>

        <p>The oversize Pirelli P Zero tires shudder a warning before breaking loose from the wet pavement. But my reaction is a few tenths of a second slow. The $130,000 sports car spins out of control with a screech despite my desperate efforts to countersteer to the right.</p>
        <p>"No problem -- much better than last time," soothes my passenger and instructor, Gianni, a master of euphemism and good cheer. Habits formed from decades of driving cars as spongy as department-store Santas, we agree, cannot be changed overnight. Besides, neither we nor the 320-horsepower Ferrari 348 TB was in any real danger.</p>
        <p>This lesson in physics and humility takes place on a sprinkler-soaked patch of asphalt the size of a football field, part of the Ferrari Mugello racing complex in the hills north of Florence. I am a student at what is arguably the most thrilling (and surely the best-catered) driving school for novices in the world: the two-day Pilota Ferrari, run a dozen times a year for clients and friends of the auto maker.</p>
        <p>Not many years ago, Ferrari would have shown no more interest in teaching me to accelerate out of a hairpin turn than Isaac Stern would have in brushing up my rendition of "Three Blind Mice" on a Stradivarius. Enzo Ferrari, the imperious founder, cultivated an image of exclusivity with the skill of a maitre d'hotel assigning tables at This Year's Restaurant. Buying a Ferrari was a privilege granted with mock reluctance to Europe's leisure class, along with the filthy rich from Beverly Hills, Tokyo and Medellin. And while the street-tame models with their austerely finished interiors often proved as cantankerous as Enzo Ferrari himself -- he saved quality control for the true racing cars -- owning a Ferrari really did pay. Exotic models purchased in the 1980's often doubled in value within a year. And truly rare Ferraris, like the Testarossas of the early 1960's, occasionally trade at auction for as much as $5 million.</p>
        <p>But recession and changing tastes have rendered the old marketing formula obsolete. The giant Fiat conglomerate, which took over the Ferrari enterprise after Enzo's death in 1988, must now cope with a shrinking demand for symbols of material excess. Hence Ferrari's new customer-friendly face in general and the $4,000 driving school at Mugello in particular. The idea is to get just plain folks who own Ferraris or who could be convinced to buy one to find out how much fun they are to drive.</p>
        <p>The first day begins with a lecture on oversteer and whatnot. But our class of 23 men (mostly middle-aged professionals) and one woman (a French executive with Jaguar) is distracted, lusting for a taste of the Ferraris that await us. Andrea De Adamich, the former Formula One driver who runs the school, is not there to disappoint. Five lithe 348's and five broader-shouldered 512 TR's idle in rows, each sporting Ferrari's mirrorlike red paint job. Two Alfa Romeo SZ's -- squat, thuggish vehicles -- are the pace cars.</p>
        <p>Young women in Ferrari jackets, looking like models in an Armani ad, assign the first group for an orientation spin. The rest of us take consolation in thimble-size cups of espresso. (Nowhere at Mugello are we more than 10 steps from a cup. Even the vans that haul the race cars from the factory have cappuccino makers on board.)</p>
        <p>Then it is my turn, and I draw a 12-cylinder, 421-horsepower 512 TR, successor to the Testarossa as the movie mogul's envymobile of choice. The leather seat is stiff yet surprisingly comfortable. The controls are spartan. Only the signature chrome shift lever poking out of a maze of steel gates betrays the fact that I am ensconced in the ultimate boy's toy. Enrico, yet another cheerful instructor, checks my driving position, and off I go.</p>
        <p>Mugello is a 3.2-mile track with 16 turns, most of them poorly banked; your father's Oldsmobile would have trouble averaging 40 miles an hour. Professionals in racing cars manage easily at 110 miles per hour, topping out at about 200 m.p.h. on the straightaway in front of the bleachers.</p>
        <p>We dawdle through a few laps, with Gianni explaining by radio into my earphones how to minimize the lateral thrust in each turn by "following the line" -- aiming at cones set at strategic spots along the edges of the track. Racing cars, it soon becomes apparent, requires both quick reflexes and an intuitive connection to the vehicle.</p>
        <p>After a few off-track sessions to learn the basics of recovering from a spin, the pace is increased to white-knuckle velocity. "Easy, easy," counsels Enrico over the radio. "Sacrifice the first turn of the S, accelerate smoothly, smoothly out of the second."</p>
        <p>I comply too cautiously, letting the Alfa ahead of me gain a few car lengths. "More throttle, more throttle," shouts Enrico. "You're driving a Ferrari!"</p>
        <p>Indeed I am. And when the circuit is finally etched into my brain, I relax sufficiently to test my newly won skills on these glorious machines. We drive for hours, alternating between the 348's and the 512's.</p>
        <p>The 512 is a muscular beast whose throaty rumble at idle is transformed to a roar by the time I shift from third to fourth at about 90 miles an hour. Given a mile of straight smooth pavement (I wasn't), it can reach 190 m.p.h. The 348 is a tabby by comparison, lacking the explosive acceleration of the 512. But its better balance, musical V-8 and predictability in the tight curves made it my favorite.</p>
        <p>The sweet perfection of it all (not to mention the bottomless glasses of Chianti and grappa at dinner) makes comrades of the disparate student body -- the Mercedes-Benz dealer from Mexico City, the cardiologist from New York, the banker from Geneva, the nephew of the King of Spain. They talk solemnly of driving and collecting Ferraris as a rite in the religion of hedonism.</p>
        <p>If worship at the altar of Ferrari is beyond your means, there are some low-church alternatives that are far from humble. The BMW/Skip Barber Driving School (203-824-0771) offers one- and two-day courses at some of the prettiest race tracks in America, using nifty little 3-series BMW's. The Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving (800-842-7223) near Phoenix does a boffo four-day course that starts in Mustang GT's and ends up in Formula Ford race cars.</p>
        <p>Whatever the setting, going very fast in a very good car without Smokey on your tail is a kick. And it might even make you a better driver: De Adamich gravely (and sincerely) notes that the skills required to drive a Ferrari near its limits are much the same as those needed to keep a Buick from plowing into a tree on an ice-slicked highway.</p>
        <p>From the company's perspective, of course, safety is a lagniappe. The point of Pilota Ferrari is to transform the superaffluent into addicts craving yet another six-figure fix. For me, the real high was the sense of guiltless pleasure, of ever so briefly becoming part of a world where the sun always shines, the fibers are always natural and the toughest choice is between second gear and third.
