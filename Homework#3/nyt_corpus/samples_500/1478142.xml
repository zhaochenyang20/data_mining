        <p>There are more ways than one to view ''Hukkle,'' the luminous directorial debut of Gyorgi Palfi, a Hungarian filmmaker whose intensified, child's-eye apprehension of the natural world might be described as psychedelic. If you're attracted to pure, exquisitely photographed cinematic depictions of the world, you could almost lie down in ''Hukkle'' as if it were a meadow and soak in its sun-drenched atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The film has hardly any spoken words, and except for a scene of a church chorus, the sounds humans make are treated as another manifestation of environmental noise on a teeming soundtrack. That soundtrack is a kind of pastoral symphony that lends the hum of the rural outdoors (with indoor sidetracks to a country kitchen and a sewing factory) a layered richness that seems three-dimensional.</p>

        <p>There are more ways than one to view ''Hukkle,'' the luminous directorial debut of Gyorgi Palfi, a Hungarian filmmaker whose intensified, child's-eye apprehension of the natural world might be described as psychedelic. If you're attracted to pure, exquisitely photographed cinematic depictions of the world, you could almost lie down in ''Hukkle'' as if it were a meadow and soak in its sun-drenched atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The film has hardly any spoken words, and except for a scene of a church chorus, the sounds humans make are treated as another manifestation of environmental noise on a teeming soundtrack. That soundtrack is a kind of pastoral symphony that lends the hum of the rural outdoors (with indoor sidetracks to a country kitchen and a sewing factory) a layered richness that seems three-dimensional.</p>
        <p>But as the movie builds up its bucolic vision, it also teases you with enigmatic clues to an actual murder in the rural Hungarian village where it takes place. You don't have to piece together these clues to be satisfied with the film, which New Directors/New Films is showing today and tomorrow. It works just fine as a sophisticated wildlife documentary with a submerged narrative. But if you enjoy the challenge of solving difficult mysteries, ''Hukkle'' presents a tantalizing case waiting to be cracked.</p>
        <p>The film's central figure is an old man who emerges from his shack by the side of a road and sits on a bench observing the rural traffic. This wizened sentinel, to whom the movie returns again and again, remains silent except for a prolonged case of the hiccups, whose sounds (the movie's title is a pun on ''hiccup'') supply witty, deflating punctuation.</p>
        <p>''Hukkle'' portrays this solitary figure, as well the other people in the film, as creatures who are not much different from the insects, fish, farm animals and domestic pets surrounding them. The director's vision has much in common with the dour cinematic portraits of Gallic small-town life drawn by the French director Bruno Dumont, but he carries the same surreal impulse much further. By paying as close attention to the activities of bees, ants, cats and moles (photographed in extreme close-up) as he pays to humans, he insinuates a radically skewed vision of the food chain in which all species are interconnected and equal in life and death.</p>
        <p>One theme of the film is the agricultural process that puts food on people's tables. Sequences observe grain being harvested and turned into flour, beekeeping and the gathering of honey. A frog is swallowed by a fish, which in turn is caught by a fisherman. These commonplace activities wouldn't be worth recording if they weren't enthrallingly photographed (by Gergely Poharnok) with an eye that marvels at the vibrancy of matter itself.</p>
        <p>As the film goes along, its tone darkens. A kitten frolicking in a field suddenly keels over dead, perhaps from accidental poisoning. A honeybee held between two fingers is crushed to death.</p>
        <p>By the end of ''Hukkle,'' the images of violence and predation have erased the mood of benignity, and the rumbling bass notes of this pastoral symphony evoke a sustained moan of despair.</p>
