        <p>LEAD: When the trial of 40 merchants accused of importing and selling tainted cooking oil that killed more than 600 people opened here in late March, it was expected to last six months. Court officials now estimate the trial will continue the rest of the year.</p>
        <p>When the trial of 40 merchants accused of importing and selling tainted cooking oil that killed more than 600 people opened here in late March, it was expected to last six months. Court officials now estimate the trial will continue the rest of the year.</p>
        <p>The defense in the proceeding, which goes into a month-long recess this week, contends that the cause of the deaths lies elsewhere, probably in tomatoes from Almeria in southern Spain that were sprayed with a combination of the pesticides Nemacur and Oftanol. But so far, as expected, most witnesses have attributed the casualties to denatured rapeseed oil intended for industrial use but sold as cooking oil.</p>
        <p>Attention has centered on the testimony of Sir Richard Doll, the 74-year-old British epidemiologist and discoverer of the causal link between tobacco and lung cancer. He said the oil caused the deaths.</p>
        <p>The mysterious illness broke out in the spring of 1981, mostly in the Madrid area. The symptoms included respiratory problems, skin disorders and a weakening of the body's immune system. The oil had been bought from street vendors by many low-income families, restaurants and others.</p>
        <p>After an emotional start, with hundreds of surviving victims crowded outside the courtroom, high feelings have subsided. The court is wading through 250,000 pages of an investigation report and examining 2,500 people, including Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and his Deputy, Alfonso Guerra.</p>
        <p>In the last month, however, public interest has revived with the arrival of scientific experts, Spanish and international. Approximately 50 experts have testified on possible causes. More than 100 people are scheduled to testify when the trial resumes in September. According to official figures, still disputed, more than 600 people have died and some 25,000 have been affected.</p>
        <p>Nearly all experts testifying this month have said that the symptoms described by victims were not consistent with those known to be associated with poisoning by compounds such as pesticides. Though the experts say they do not know the precise cause of the toxic syndrome, one, Raphael Garrido Lesteche, told the court, ''I saw that when the oil was fully withdrawn and was no longer consumed, no more cases were produced.''</p>
        <p>Last week, Dr. Jose Baguena said in court that the herbicide paraquat may have contaminated the tanks in which the oil was transported. The theory met little support from other experts.</p>
        <p>Last week a telegram sent by the World Health Organization to its committee of experts on toxic syndrome was read in court. It also links the disease to the ingestion of denatured rapeseed oil containing aniline, a poisonous, oily derivative of benzene. The message also stressed the correlation between the severity of the disease and the aniline content in the oil that patients ingested.</p>
        <p>W.H.O. experts can not testify in this trial in an official capacity, though they may do so as individuals.</p>
        <p>In his court appearance, Professor Doll explained that epidemiologists have established in many cases the causal relation between a disease and the toxic agent that caused it, without being able to specify the latter nor reproduce the full range of symptoms in animals. ''I'm satisfied that the oil was responsible,'' he said later.</p>
