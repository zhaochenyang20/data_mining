        <p>LEAD: THE tag sale was not to begin until 10 A.M. but some anxious customers were parked along the road the night before and had slept in their cars. More shoppers arrived at 7:30 A.M. and by 9:45, just before the sale was to open, dozens of people were lined up at the door hoping for the first crack at the advertised set of Mercedes tires, spinet piano and Oriental rug, as well as the hundreds of other items that are traditionally sold at low prices at such sales.</p>

        <p>LEAD: THE tag sale was not to begin until 10 A.M. but some anxious customers were parked along the road the night before and had slept in their cars. More shoppers arrived at 7:30 A.M. and by 9:45, just before the sale was to open, dozens of people were lined up at the door hoping for the first crack at the advertised set of Mercedes tires, spinet piano and Oriental rug, as well as the hundreds of other items that are traditionally sold at low prices at such sales.</p>
        <p>THE tag sale was not to begin until 10 A.M. but some anxious customers were parked along the road the night before and had slept in their cars. More shoppers arrived at 7:30 A.M. and by 9:45, just before the sale was to open, dozens of people were lined up at the door hoping for the first crack at the advertised set of Mercedes tires, spinet piano and Oriental rug, as well as the hundreds of other items that are traditionally sold at low prices at such sales. Before the sale was over, hundreds of people would pass through the Stamford house on this Saturday.</p>
        <p>''It's physically and mentally very taxing,'' said Lynn Westmeyer, whose Stamford company, the Good Riddance Girls, managed the tag sale. Her partner, Debby Berman, added: ''You have to like this kind of thing. You're running up and down the stairs, down to the patio, to the garage, out to the backyard and up the stairs again.''</p>
        <p>For people like Ms. Westmeyer and Ms. Berman whose business is to run other people's tag or estate sales, the work actually starts weeks earlier. And tag-sale professionals say that this year they are busier than ever.  More Sellers, More Buyers</p>
        <p>They report that more and more people are disposing of their household contents through tag sales and that the number of people who shop at these sales is also growing.</p>
        <p>''People these days like to buy things at tag sales because you can get a $600 chair for $50,'' Ms. Westmeyer said.</p>
        <p>Most tag-sale managers are in Fairfield County. Unlike the type of sale in which knickknacks are piled high on folding tables and children's board games, toys and old clothing are scattered on the lawn, professionally run sales are conducted inside the house, and many tag-sale companies will not take a job if they estimate the sale value of the merchandise at under $4,000 or $5,000.</p>
        <p>Most people in the tag-sale business are licensed appraisers. And all must be licensed through the state tax department in order to operate.</p>
        <p>People who hire tag-sale professionals are usually moving because of divorce or a new job; often the assignment is to handle the estate of a deceased relative.</p>
        <p>''It gets it all over with in a big hurry,'' said Carl DuBois, who hired the Good Riddance Girls to sell the contents of his parents' ranch house in Stamford a few years ago after they died. The sale included two Steinway grand pianos and 11 diamond rings.</p>
        <p>''It's like using a real-estate agent instead of selling your own home,'' he said. ''It's really better to use a professional.''</p>
        <p>The Good Riddance Girls recently held one of the roughly 50 sales they handle each year. Like other tag-sale professionals, they spend about a month preparing for each one.</p>
        <p>The process starts with an assessment of the estate to determine whether there is enough merchandise to make it worth their while. They get 25 percent of the gross sales, Ms. Berman said. Next, they take photographs of some of the more impressive items, like boats, antiques and jewelry, and make up flyers to send to people on their mailing list.</p>
        <p>The Good Riddance Girls then place newspaper advertisements. On the Monday before the sale, they begin the tedious task of marking a price on each item. Since they work on commission, it is advantageous to make everything look as good as possible, which may include polishing furniture and making small repairs.</p>
        <p>Merchandise is set up in its natural setting. For instance, a quilt would be spread over a bed; a couch would be in its normal position in the living room, and plants would be near a sunny window.</p>
        <p>On the day of the sale, the homeowners, if still living in the house, leave for the day, and Ms. Westmeyer and Ms. Berman take over with their hired help.  Unbeatable Bargains</p>
        <p>Their efforts do not go unnoticed. In addition to the lure of tag sales - finding unbeatable bargains - more people are drawn to the sales when items are set up attractively, and it also brings in more money, Ms. Berman said.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Denton and Joan Gurasich, the new owners of the Stamford house at which the Good Riddance Girls held the recent tag sale, went to the sale, which was the first they had ever attended. They bought lawn furniture for $500 and some plants. ''Now we're going to go to other sales to look for a boat for the pond,'' Ms. Gurasich said. ''As long as you're willing to come and spend the time and sort through the junk, it's worth it.''</p>
        <p>Sorting through the junk is what tag-sale professionals say lures them to the field and keeps them there. Many call their work ''eternal treasure hunts.'' They often find treasures that homeowners did not know about or thought were valueless in the recesses of attics and basements, in closets and under floorboards and even in the garbage.</p>
        <p>For instance, Ms. Berman said she has found Indian pottery worth $200 to $400 and expensive jewelry and coin collections stuffed in rafters and nooks and crannies in attics. She has also found $100 bills placed between dinner plates, and a Blunderbuss, a hand pistol from the 1700's, which was loaded and assessed at $300. Ms. Berman sells such items at the tag sale.  'Every House Is Different'</p>
        <p>''What I like is that every house is different,'' said Irene Marcenaro, who owns the Westport-based Lock, Stock and Barrel Estate Sales and who has found $1,000 worth of gold in a garbage pail that had been discarded as ''old, broken jewelry.'' She has also found expensive art prints and even hand grenades in a basement, for which she had to call in the police to take away.</p>
        <p>Joneen Connor, who runs Serendipity Tag Sales in Westport, said she loves her work. ''I love digging into people's attics and basements,'' she said, but she added that the scavenger hunt can be messy.</p>
        <p>''There's literally a lot of dirty work involved,'' she said. ''You can't be squeamish. In order to find what may be a collectible, you might also find dirt or mice.''</p>
        <p>On top of all the hard work, tag-sale professionals say, is the emotional factor. ''You're dealing with people in a very emotional state,'' Ms. Connor said. ''They're giving up things that are hard for them to do. They're starting a new life, going into the unknown.''</p>
        <p>Theft is another unpleasant issue tag-sale professionals must deal with. During one sale, the owners of Those Two Girls Tag Sales in Westport, Pat Fay and Carole Maddock, helped a woman carry a white iron bench to her car. Later that day, after reviewing the receipts, they found that the woman never paid for the bench.  Avoiding Theft</p>
        <p>''We take precautions,'' Ms. Berman said. ''We have George, who's 6-feet-4, and Phil, who's 6-foot-1. You have to watch the people; you don't know who they are.''</p>
        <p>The guards are usually stationed at the doors to make sure all items are paid for before they are taken out. Sometimes, especially during sales in which there is a lot of expensive merchandise, Ms. Berman will hire an off-duty police officer.</p>
        <p>''Anti-theft measures are commonly taken during tag sales,'' she said. In addition to security people, they stamp bags and place special ''sold'' tags with the buyer's name on furniture.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fay and Ms. Maddock, who 23 years ago started their business and the concept of the professionally run tag sale in Connecticut, also conduct sales in places other than homes. They once sold the contents of a Catholic convent in Westport and the contents of a girdle factory in Southport.  Attracting Celebrities</p>
        <p>Celebrities get involved in tag sales as well, from the selling and buying end. Ms. Fay and Ms. Maddock sold the contents of Sandy Dennis's Westport home a few years ago. The most remarkable thing about the sale, they said, was Ms. Dennis's 67 cats who greeted everyone at the door. Faye Dunaway, Christopher Reeves and Gilda Radner have been some of the shoppers at the Good Riddance Girls sales.</p>
        <p>But aside from the excitement of celebrities and the treasure hunts, organizing tag sales takes a lot of time, dedication, hard work and know-how, those who run the businesses say. Because of that, many who try fail within months.</p>
        <p>''A lot of companies come and go,'' Ms. Connor said, ''because people don't realize how much is involved.''</p>
