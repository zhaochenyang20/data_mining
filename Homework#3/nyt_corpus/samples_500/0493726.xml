        <p>In the Middle East, families of hostages swallowed by dark and silence do not put out yellow ribbons; it is not their way. But they remember their men every day as achingly as do Westerners, hope as passionately for signs of life from them, mourn as deeply when hope is gone.</p>
        <p>In Israel, a whole country longs for word of Capt. Ron Arad, taken prisoner in October 1986. Israeli officials believe there is a chance he is alive.</p>
        <p>If he is dead, murdered since he was last heard from four years ago, they want his remains returned so that he can be buried in his faith and so that his family can at least grieve fully, in knowledge of his fate.</p>
        <p>Israeli diplomats are trying to seize what they fear may be the last opportunity to discover what happened to Captain Arad and to rescue him if he still breathes. They think the opening may last only a couple of weeks more.</p>
        <p>In 1986 Captain Arad was a navigator. He was 28 years old. His wife, Tami, is now 30 and they have a 6-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>His plane was shot down in Lebanon and he was captured near the Syrian border by members of a Lebanese group called Amal. At that point he was a prisoner of war, covered by international conventions under which he was supposed to be treated decently, allowed to see official observers and to have some contact with his country and family.</p>
        <p>In the Middle East, to talk of that kind of thing is black comedy. An Amal defector turned the captain over to the Iranian-sponsored Lebanese hostage-takers, the Party of God, which in turn handed him over directly to the Iranians -- the Iranian Revolutionary Guard detachment in Lebanon. About $300,000 was paid for Captain Arad by the Party of God, which gets its money from Iran.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Arad received one letter from him in 1987. She says she does not know its route. The Iranians claim to know nothing. But in Teheran President Rafsanjani did declare recently that he could not say he knew Captain Arad was dead -- a comment the Israelis take as a reed.</p>
        <p>Now Uri Lubrani, who was Israel's chief representative during the intricacies of persuading Iran to order the release of Western hostages, feels time is closing in.</p>
        <p>The term of Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who was so central to the hostage negotiations, expires at the end of this year. When he goes, so will the expertise he has acquired in the infinitely delicate specialty of handling kidnapper-nations and victim-nations simultaneously. So, presumably, will Giandomenico Picco, his personal envoy, a soldier of diplomacy.</p>
        <p>The Israelis hope these two men can be important to the Arad case. The Secretary General has agreed to send Mr. Picco back to Teheran for one more try at the case -- and getting the remains of two or three Israeli soldiers probably dead.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials also have seen key people in Washington, urging that any arrangements made with Iran be made contingent on getting at the truth about Captain Arad. For this the Israelis are ready to release their most important captive, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, the Lebanese Shiite cleric, and all remaining Lebanese prisoners in Israeli hands, about 220 of them.</p>
        <p>The United States says it did not negotiate with the kidnappers. It did not have to, with the Secretary General and the Israelis handling the job.</p>
        <p>To help free the Western hostages, the Israelis released about 90 prisoners on an agreed schedule. When the hostages were released, American thanks went to Iran and Syria.</p>
        <p>Israelis had hoped not for thanks as reward but the truth about Captain Arad. They did not get it and are looking for help, quietly but without diplomatic pretenses, from the Secretary General, from Washington and from at least one American journalist.</p>
        <p>In five years of writing this column I have dealt often with the Middle East, Israel and Arab-Israeli struggles. Never had an Israeli official asked me to write or withhold anything or support an Israeli cause.</p>
        <p>A couple of days ago an Israeli official did come to me to ask me to write about Captain Arad. He hoped that a column now would properly point out the importance of what the Secretary General is doing as his term runs out. And he thought perhaps it might be put before President Bush, this story of one more prisoner and the invisible yellow ribbon worn by a whole country.</p>
