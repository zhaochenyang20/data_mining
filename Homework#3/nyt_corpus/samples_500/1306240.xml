        <p>Dawn Kelly, Jaredd Mooney, Jessie Kremidas and Nate Peterkin, Perkins School for the Blind, Watertown, Mass., June 7, 2001</p>
        <p>Dawn Kelly (left): ''We were just waiting to get our prom pictures taken. I already graduated from high school, but Jessie told me that Jaredd wanted to go to the prom with me. I think he likes me. Jaredd hasn't said anything to me, but his actions and other things imply it. He kept saying he's happy when I'm around. I'm partially blind. I can see some color and shapes, but no definition. I would have liked to go to a school that works well with the blind. My high school was totally lost.''</p>
        <p>Jessie Kremidas (center): ''My boyfriend turned into a loser, so I asked my friend Ray to the prom. But Ray started being a real mean person, so I ended up asking Nate. Well, Nate and I both asked each other at almost the same time. We have been off and on together for months -- not boyfriend and girlfriend, but we're close. You know how it is in high school. The dance floor was crowded. Everybody bumped into everyone. I made my friends bump into people -- it's a great way to meet people. I can see, just not really good. I'd been in the mainstream my whole life, so they had to tie me down to bring me to this school. I felt superior, I guess, that I was better than people who were blind. But now I've been there two years. I'm going to miss a lot of my friends. But I have really bad times too. I would just rather be mainstream.''</p>
        <p>Nate Peterkin (right): ''This is funny. I went to the prom with my friend's date because my friend backed out. They had a little fight before the prom. So 10 minutes before I went in, she asked me to go with her, and I said fine. You don't have to see to dance. You just dance. People tell me I'm an O.K. dancer. I fake it. I have absolutely no idea how to dance. But girls don't know you're faking it. They think you're good.''</p>
