        <p>From the public address system of the number 1 train came the voice of civility. "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen," said the voice, "and welcome to the Broadway local. I don't know whether you're interested in this sort of thing or not, but the number 2 and 3 trains may be boarded just across the platform. In fact, downtown transfers are on the house. Our final destination is South Ferry. This involves closing the doors." The woman to my left snapped out of her commuter fugue state and laughed.</p>
        <p>A soothing voice of civility on the subway -- it was wonderful. And weird. Just a few stops south, four men were on trial, charged with another sort of subway story, the one that included the brutal murder of a tourist from Utah a year ago. The voice of civility continued to come over the P.A., faintly British, so at odds with the usual sullen crackle of the speakers. But it was difficult not to think of blood on the station floor.  This is what it is like to be a New Yorker, to have to stop and constantly acknowledge pain.</p>

        <p>A soothing voice of civility on the subway -- it was wonderful. And weird. Just a few stops south, four men were on trial, charged with another sort of subway story, the one that included the brutal murder of a tourist from Utah a year ago. The voice of civility continued to come over the P.A., faintly British, so at odds with the usual sullen crackle of the speakers. But it was difficult not to think of blood on the station floor.  This is what it is like to be a New Yorker, to have to stop and constantly acknowledge pain.</p>
        <p>Sometime in the coming week Mario Cuomo may decide whether he is running for President or not. The entire business of Presidential politics, so fitful and ill favored this time around, has ground to a screeching halt, waiting for Mario. If he Godots, if he never arrives on the stump, he will become somehow irrelevant in that way politicians become irrelevant when their time for the Presidency has passed, irrelevant in the way George McGovern and Teddy Kennedy are irrelevant.</p>
        <p>This would be a waste. Mr. Cuomo has many liabilities, among them the fact that he is a son of the city that much of America thinks of as Depravity 'R' Us. This could be one of his great advantages. Pain 'R' Us, too. Mario Cuomo, the orator, the grocer's son, would be good at acknowledging pain, at asking feelingly, "Are you better off than you were four years ago?"</p>
        <p>The voice on the national public address system says the economy is improving, but almost 1 in 10 Americans are relying on food stamps, a record number. When the President refused, between boating and golf at Kennebunkport in August, to declare the budget emergency that would have extended unemployment benefits, it seemed clear that he doesn't have a clue about what it's like living in America, the America without the rambling family vacation home. His fellow Americans were taking vacations in the above-ground pool bought with the '86 bonus, seeing chlorine as a luxury item. One sad story of depleted savings and downsized hopes after another -- that's what's happening outside the inner circle of the silver spoons.</p>
        <p>There's a lot of talk going round about how Mr. Cuomo will face difficulties if he runs. He will have to answer for the budget deficits and cuts here in New York State, for his stands on capital punishment and abortion. He will say that the economy is in a mess, instead of trying to pretend that things are improving. He will not run from his unpopular positions, unlike George Bush, who tailored his stand on abortion to suit the prevailing winds.</p>
        <p>The Governor will evoke, not deny, the fact that we have become a people who anticipate downward mobility for our children. That fear is a turning point in the American psyche.  Some Republicans are gleeful about the ascendancy of Mr. Cuomo, the urban ethnic with the vocabulary of a theologian and the face of a mournful hound. The glee is premature. No one could better suggest that the two highest elected officials in this country are men who believe privilege is a christening gift.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo may be vulnerable to attack on everything from his ethnicity (now we may see how the Republicans really feel about our tired, our poor, our Italian-Americans) to New York's economy.</p>
        <p>But let's not look at his vulnerability in a vacuum; let's not pretend he would be challenging Abe Lincoln.  Clarence Thomas. Family leave.  John Sununu. Unemployment benefits. Willie Horton. The gulf war. Iran-contra. Above all, the economy. The soothing voice is seductive, especially when things are as bad as they are today. But in George Bush's case, it is the voice of a man who knows no more about hard times than he does about hard questions. This election should encompass both. The President has plenty to answer for if only the right person asks. The right person is Mario Cuomo.</p>
