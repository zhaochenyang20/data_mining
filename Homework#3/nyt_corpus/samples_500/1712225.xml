        <p>Judging Craters</p>
        <p>To estimate the surface age of an object in the solar system, astronomers often count craters. Since the frequency of bombardment by asteroids and comets is fairly well known, the number of craters on a moon, say, can be a good indicator of how long the surface has been exposed. It's a little like gauging the age of a horse by seeing how much the teeth are worn down.</p>
        <p>One problem with the method is that it is not always easy to tell if a crater is a primary one from a direct impact or a secondary one caused by material ejected from a large primary impact.</p>

        <p>Judging Craters</p>
        <p>To estimate the surface age of an object in the solar system, astronomers often count craters. Since the frequency of bombardment by asteroids and comets is fairly well known, the number of craters on a moon, say, can be a good indicator of how long the surface has been exposed. It's a little like gauging the age of a horse by seeing how much the teeth are worn down.</p>
        <p>One problem with the method is that it is not always easy to tell if a crater is a primary one from a direct impact or a secondary one caused by material ejected from a large primary impact.</p>
        <p>If a lot of craters, particularly smaller ones, are counted as primaries but are in fact secondaries, an age estimate can be inaccurate.</p>
        <p>A study of the craters on Jupiter's icy moon Europa suggests that secondary craters are more common than previously thought.</p>
        <p>The analysis, by Edward B. Bierhaus of Lockheed Martin's space exploration systems division and colleagues from the Southwest Research Institute, found that about 95 percent of Europa's small craters (those less than about half a mile across) are secondaries.</p>
        <p>The researchers measured more than 27,000 craters from images of Europa and used software to study their spatial distribution.</p>
        <p>Secondary craters tend to be in clusters, but the researchers, who reported their findings in Nature, concluded that even many craters that appear randomly distributed are secondaries.</p>
        <p>A large primary impact produces many fragments that sail long and far, becoming quite separated spatially.</p>
        <p>The study suggests that using small craters to estimate surface age is a questionable proposition, on Europa and perhaps elsewhere in the solar system.</p>
        <p>And because comets are thought to be the main source of impacts on Europa and other jovian moons, the study suggests that there have been relatively few small comets (less than 100 yards in diameter, the kind that would make small craters) passing through the region in recent times.</p>
        <p>Antifreeze: Fleas Do It</p>
        <p>To avoid tissue injury or death, creatures that live in extremely cold environments need protection. That means some kind of antifreeze, proteins that prevent freezing of blood or other fluids by suppressing the formation of ice crystals.</p>
        <p>Antifreeze proteins are most commonly thought of as occurring in fish, particularly saltwater species that can survive in salt water that is colder than 32 degrees Fahrenheit. But other animals and plants have been discovered to have them, too.</p>
        <p>The latest is the lowly snow flea, a tiny creature that can be found on the surface of snow.</p>
        <p>Laurie A. Graham and Peter L. Davies of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, report in Science that the flea (which is not a flea or even an insect, but rather a springtail) has unique antifreeze proteins that do not resemble those found in any other known organism.</p>
        <p>The proteins contain a lot of the amino acid glycine and were more active than the proteins found in fish, meaning they were able to provide protection at lower temperatures -- more than 10 degrees below the freezing point in tests.</p>
        <p>The researchers say their finding suggests that freezing protection developed independently among arthropod species.</p>
        <p>Distinct species may have evolved in a warmer climate, and then when things got colder, each species adapted on its own.</p>
        <p>Lambchop Genome</p>
        <p>Think you know a lot about sheep? The Australians have you beaten by a mile. Wool and meat industry groups there have announced the creation of a database containing genetic information about two million of the animals.</p>
        <p>The goal of Sheep Genetics Australia, as the project is known, is to improve breeding by allowing sheep breeders and producers to compare flocks on a genetic basis.</p>
        <p>While two million is a lot of animals, it represents only about 2 percent of Australia's sheep population. Still, that's enough for meaningful genetic evaluations to be made.</p>
        <p>The Bird Next Door</p>
        <p>Like New Yorkers who head to Florida for the holidays every year, European blackcaps long had a preferred winter destination. The migratory songbirds would leave their breeding territory in central Europe and head southwest for Spain and Portugal.</p>
        <p>In the last few decades, however, more and more of the birds have flown northwest, to spend winter in the British Isles. The reasons for this split -- and similar changes in migration patterns among other birds -- are little known.</p>
        <p>A study by Stuart Bearhop of Queen's University Belfast and colleagues sheds some light on the mechanism. At the breeding grounds in Germany and Austria, the researchers report in Science, blackcaps tend to mate with others that have wintered in the same place. This mating pattern has led to the development of the separate migratory population.</p>
        <p>For the study, Dr. Bearhop said, ''We really needed to be able to identify birds coming from England and those from Spain and Portugal.'' To do so, they took claw clippings from the birds and analyzed them for different isotopes of hydrogen. Different rainfall patterns in the wintering areas produce different ratios of hydrogen isotopes in the water. As the birds drink the water, the ratios are reflected in growing tissues like claws.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bearhop and his colleagues clipped birds' claws at eight breeding sites. When they studied mating patterns among the identified birds, ''the data strongly suggested that birds are pairing up with birds from the same general area,'' Dr. Bearhop said. They probably do so because birds from Britain arrive at the breeding sites about 10 days before those from Iberia.</p>
        <p>Birds that migrate to more northern breeding sites were also shown to produce more offspring than those who flew farther south. This might be due to several factors, Dr. Bearhop said. Northerly migrators have a shorter trip, so they can save more energy for reproduction. By arriving earlier, they get the best breeding sites. And Britons tend to make life easy for migrating birds by putting out feeders.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bearhop said the migratory shift probably started with a few birds that went to Britain, returned, mated and produced more offspring, which in turn went to Britain, and on and on. ''This has very probably been going on for a very long time,'' Dr. Bearhop said. ''Britain has become a very good place for them to overwinter.''</p>
