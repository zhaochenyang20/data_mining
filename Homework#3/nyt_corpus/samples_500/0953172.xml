        <p>It is one down and one to go for H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries, the nation's largest car dealership owner.</p>
        <p>Republic, which has been feuding in the courts with the United States arm of the Toyota Motor Company and with the American Honda Motor Company, reached a preliminary agreement late yesterday with Toyota that would allow Republic to buy more Toyota dealerships and would end litigation between the two sides.

        <p>It is one down and one to go for H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries, the nation's largest car dealership owner.</p>
        <p>Republic, which has been feuding in the courts with the United States arm of the Toyota Motor Company and with the American Honda Motor Company, reached a preliminary agreement late yesterday with Toyota that would allow Republic to buy more Toyota dealerships and would end litigation between the two sides. The deal with Toyota came after more than six hours of meetings in Dallas between the two sides.</p>
        <p>dr</p>
        <p>Neither company would disclose details of the framework agreement last night. But given the public animosity between the two only days ago, the announcement seemed to signal a breakthrough. ''We've agreed to agree,'' said Nancy J. Hubbell, a Toyota spokeswoman. She added that both sides had given in to the other's demands.</p>
        <p>For the last nine months, Republic has been snapping up car dealerships nationwide, with the blessing of many auto makers that are eager to thin the ranks of their dealers and modernize the dealerships. Toyota and Honda, however, have resisted. Each adopted policies intended to slow sales to large dealer groups like Republic, and each sued Republic when it refused to stop making offers to buy dealers.</p>
        <p>Republic countersued. Watching its stock price fall by nearly half this year, Mr. Huizenga then accused the Japanese auto makers of trying to drive down the price of Republic stock by creating uncertainty. Republic has often used its stock as currency for buying dealerships.</p>
        <p>The deal announced yesterday was reached after the stock market closed. Earlier, shares of Republic, rose 25 cents, to $23.4375, on the New York Stock Exchange. In June, the stock hit a low of $20.3125.</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts were cautious about the possible impact of an agreement, given the uncertainty over the details.</p>
        <p>''A lot depends on the structure of the agreement: how many Toyota dealers they are allowed to buy,'' said David B. Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities. ''A lot more depends on Republic's stock price than it does the agreement with Toyota.''</p>
        <p>After the meeting yesterday, Republic and Toyota issued a joint statement: ''We are very happy that Toyota and Republic have reached the framework of an agreement that will be mutually beneficial to both companies, while protecting the interests of customers and dealers.''</p>
        <p>Even if Republic's preliminary agreement with Toyota is carried through to a broad deal, there is still a gulf between Republic and Honda. Earlier yesterday, Honda asked the Federal District Court in Los Angeles for a preliminary injunction barring Republic from acquiring any more of its dealerships.</p>
        <p>Honda had already filed a lawsuit on May 7 asking the same court to halt Republic's acquisitions on the grounds that the speed and scale of the purchases violated the auto maker's dealership policies and could hurt the auto maker's reputation if Republic proved unable to manage the dealerships. Republic has said that both legal actions are without merit.</p>
        <p>But after the Toyota deal was announced, Honda seemed hopeful. Michael L. Spencer, a spokesman for American Honda, said that the auto maker had not been invited to the Dallas meeting and did not participate in it. ''We're a little bit surprised'' by the agreement, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spencer said that while Honda did not have any settlement talks scheduled with Republic, the company was encouraged by tonight's deal. ''Hopefully this signals a new evolution within Republic, that they're now more willing to negotiate and make concessions,'' he said, while adding, ''We're not willing to tear up our dealership agreements for them.''</p>
        <p>Even the agreement with Toyota leaves many issues to be resolved. Ms. Hubbell, the Toyota spokeswoman, said that no date had yet been set for the additional negotiations that would be necessary to reach a full deal.</p>
