        <p>''I know nothing.''</p>
        <p>That phrase, from a television sitcom that ended its original run when Richard M. Nixon was president, is resonating again decades later in the most recent sign of the durability of the detritus of popular culture.</p>
        <p>The phrase was evoked on Thursday by Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, during the testimony of Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive of the Enron Corporation. The congressman's remark -- that Mr. Skilling was using ''the Sergeant Schultz defense of 'I see nothing, I hear nothing' '' -- was intended to express skepticism of Mr. Skilling's testimony that he was unaware of the problematic practices that led Enron to file for bankruptcy protection.</p>
        <p>''I know nothing'' -- also rendered as ''I see nothing, I hear nothing, I know nothing'' -- was uttered innumerable times during the six-year run on CBS of the sitcom ''Hogan's Heroes.'' The character who made the phrase part of the vernacular was Sgt. Hans Schultz, played by the actor John Banner. Schultz, along with Col. Wilhelm Klink, was among the German officers who oversaw Stalag 13, the World War II prisoner- of-war camp that was the setting for the series.</p>
        <p>The phrase ''I know nothing'' has become shorthand for blind ignorance of obvious facts because it was used by Schultz to profess his supposed inability to uncover or stop the schemes to undermine the Nazi war effort by the Allied prisoners, led by Col. Robert Hogan.</p>
        <p>That a catch phrase from a sitcom that ran from 1965 to 1971 is still heard is not so unusual in an America that looks to the popular culture to make points on weightier matters.</p>
        <p>For instance, in a 1995 decision by the Indiana Supreme Court, Indiana Department of State Revenue v. Zinat Safayan, Ms. Safayan's case was summarized as ''a tax code version of the Sergeant Schultz defense,'' described in a footnote: ''The Sergeant Schultz defense refers, of course, to the refrain of the character by that name in the television comedy 'Hogan's Heroes.' ''</p>
        <p>In the current campaign in Illinois to nominate candidates to run to succeed Gov. George Ryan, the incumbent whose term has been plagued by scandal, one Republican, State Senator Patrick O'Malley, has posted on his Web site an article that describes Mr. Ryan as the governor ''who was there but says, like Sergeant Schultz in 'Hogan's Heroes,' 'I know nothing.' ''</p>
        <p>On ''Special Report With Brit Hume'' on the Fox News Channel in January 2001, Mr. Hume compared Hillary Rodham Clinton to Schultz in characterizing her denials of knowledge of her brother's role in a pardon granted by President Bill Clinton to a businessman.</p>
        <p>Of course, speakers and journalists do not have to rely on dim memories of ''Hogan's Heroes'' on which to base their references. After leaving CBS, the series was rerun on local stations. The reruns resurfaced nationally with occasional appearances in the Nick at Nite programming block on the Nickelodeon cable network, owned by Viacom.</p>
        <p>The reruns moved to a sibling channel, TV Land, in April 1996, and they still appear, twice daily at 8:30 a.m. and 11:30 p.m. Eastern time. The series is also featured on the TV Land Web site (www.tvland.com) and has been the subject of advertisements by the network to encourage viewership.</p>
        <p>''It's a great performer for us,'' Larry W. Jones, executive vice president and general manager for TV Land and Nick at Nite in New York, said yesterday, adding that it appealed to both ''people who are familiar with the show and people finding it for the first time.''</p>
        <p>''As soon as someone says 'I know nothing,' you know exactly what he means,'' he added. ''It's something that's 30 years old and yet it never went away.''</p>
        <p>''Hogan's Heroes'' was produced by CBS with the singer Bing Crosby and created by Bernard Fein and Albert S. Ruddy; Mr. Ruddy later produced films like ''The Godfather'' and ''The Longest Yard.''</p>
        <p>''When I read it this morning, I fell out of my chair,'' Mr. Ruddy said yesterday in a telephone interview, referring to Representative Markey's remarks. ''It was very apropos, I must say.''</p>
        <p>''Schultz always knew what was going on,'' Mr. Ruddy said. ''He would turn a blind eye. He just didn't want to get involved.''</p>
        <p>As for whether the Schultz defense could work for Enron executives, Mr. Ruddy said: ''You can get away with it in a television series. It's a little harder when it's real.''</p>
