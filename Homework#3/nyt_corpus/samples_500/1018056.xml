        <p>Reports of serious crime fell across the nation in 1997, the sixth consecutive annual decrease, with the biggest drop in the Northeastern states and in big cities, the Justice Department said today.</p>
        <p>Preliminary figures released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which collected them from 16,000 city, county and state law-enforcement agencies, showed that the overall rate of serious crime fell 4 percent, accelerating the decline of recent years.</p>
        <p>Violent crimes declined by 5 percent, led by 9 percent decreases in murders and robberies. There were smaller decreases in the categories of aggravated assault, down 2 percent, and rape, down 1 percent.</p>
        <p>Rape was the one type of crime for which the statistics showed less progress. Reported rapes declined 2 percent in 1996, 5 percent in 1995, and 4 percent in 1994.</p>
        <p>Property crimes declined by 4 percent, led by an 8 percent drop in arson. Car thefts fell 5 percent.</p>
        <p>The Northeastern states led the decline in virtually every category. Murders in the region declined 13 percent, total violent crimes declined 5 percent and property crimes declined 6 percent.</p>
        <p>Experts have said several trends were contributing to the declining pace of crime. Among them were the aging of the population, a toughening of sentencing laws and the increasing numbers of people in prison. The healthy economy was also a factor, experts said.</p>
        <p>Cities with populations over a million reported that murders and robberies each declined 11 percent. Cities with populations of half a million to a million reported murders and robberies each down 10 percent. Cities with populations of a quarter of a million to half a million reported murders down 14 percent and robberies down 10 percent.</p>
        <p>In New York City, the total number of crimes counted in the report declined 7 percent, to 355,893 in 1997 from 382,555 in 1996. Murders declined 22 percent, to 770 from 983, and robberies dropped 10 percent, to 44,707 from 49,672. The number of reported rapes in New York City fell to 2,157 from 2,332.</p>
