        <p>It's two down and one to go among the republics that inherited nuclear arms when the Soviet Union broke up. Kazakhstan is about to follow Belarus's lead and get rid of its nuclear legacy. That leaves a lone holdout: stubborn Ukraine.</p>
        <p>Ukraine has turned its tactical nuclear arms over to Russia for dismantling. And it's removing the warheads from aging SS-19 missiles. But President Leonid Kravchuk, who last year pledged to give up all of Ukraine's arms, now wants to keep some. The ones he has in mind, 46 intercontinental-range SS-24 missiles, were designed to target the U.S., and fly too far to strike most of Russia.</p>
        <p>Ostensibly, Mr. Kravchuk is driving a hard bargain in an effort to win financial aid from the West. But his eagerness to appease Ukrainian nationalists could be a deal-stopper.</p>
        <p>The nationalists see nuclear arms as a symbol of power and don't want to give them up. But nuclear weapons won't put food on the table. They're an expensive distraction from the true threat: the social unrest that's sure to follow if Ukraine's economy collapses. Unless Ukraine is prepared to spend billions it can't afford to pay for the infrastructure to control, re-target and maintain the warheads, they are a wasting asset.</p>
        <p>Belarus and Kazakhstan understood that and knew the time had come to cut a deal. Belarus has begun to send its nuclear missiles back to Russia for dismantling. Washington has already provided financial inducements. The U.S. could also help things along by supporting Belarus's bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council. That would provide an important reminder to Ukraine and others that nuclear arms do not assure a seat at the head table.</p>
        <p>Kazakhstan has agreed to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by year's end. For its troubles it will get $140 million in economic aid and much, much more, like investment to develop its oil and natural gas, $85 million to help dismantle its nuclear arsenal and millions more to clean up the nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk.</p>
        <p>Kazakhstan's President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, wants a face-to-face meeting with President Clinton to clinch the deal. President Kravchuk of Ukraine also wants a summit soiree in Washington before facing the electorate back home. But why give him one now? Rewarding Mr. Nazarbayev with a photo opportunity while denying one to Mr. Kravchuk would allow Mr. Clinton to show that the way to win Washington's favors is to disarm.</p>
