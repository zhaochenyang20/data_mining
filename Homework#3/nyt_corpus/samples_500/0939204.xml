        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As you report (news article, June 20), the Supreme Court decided that Joseph O'Dell could be executed by Virginia even though the jury that sentenced him to death was not told that if it spared his life, he would never be released from prison.</p>
        <p>This violated a rule that the Court has recognized since 1994. Still, the Court ruled, Mr. O'Dell may be executed because -- in the view of a 5-to-4 majority -- the rule had not been clearly established in 1988, when Mr. O'Dell's initial appeals ran out.</p>
        <p>As the Association of the Bar of the City of New York concluded in 1989, a system that so transfers the risk of legal uncertainty from the government that created it to the citizen whom that government seeks to execute is antithetical to fundamental principles of justice.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the practical effect is to reward stalling tactics. A prisoner who has somehow managed to keep his or her case tied up in the state courts will benefit from favorable changes in the law, while his or her more diligent co-defendant, convicted on the same day of the same crime, will not.</p>
        <p>Unless Gov. George Allen rescues Mr. O'Dell, he will go to the electric chair simply because he presented a meritorious legal argument before the courts had agreed on its correctness.</p>
        <p>ERIC M. FREEDMAN  New York, June 20, 1997</p>
        <p>The writer is chairman of the Committee on Civil Rights, Association of the Bar of the City of New York.</p>
