        <p>In a troubling signal for states seeking relief from the costs associated with illegal immigration, a Federal District Court judge today threw out a lawsuit in which Florida officials sought to recover nearly $1 billion a year from the Federal Government to pay for services to illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>In his decision, Judge Edward B. Davis said he recognized the tremendous financial burden to Florida "due to the methods in which the Federal Government has chosen to enforce the immigration laws." But he said that did not create a legal theory under which the state could recover money.</p>

        <p>In a troubling signal for states seeking relief from the costs associated with illegal immigration, a Federal District Court judge today threw out a lawsuit in which Florida officials sought to recover nearly $1 billion a year from the Federal Government to pay for services to illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>In his decision, Judge Edward B. Davis said he recognized the tremendous financial burden to Florida "due to the methods in which the Federal Government has chosen to enforce the immigration laws." But he said that did not create a legal theory under which the state could recover money.</p>
        <p>The judge agreed with the Federal Government's argument that the case presented "a political question," not a legal one, over "the proper allocation of Federal resources and the execution of discretionary policies" dealing with national defense, immigration and foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>The decision was a bad omen for at least six other states that have also sued to shift costs to Washington for some immigration-related expenses, saying they are bearing a disproportionately high influx of illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>Seeking restitution in court is seen by some of those states as a preferable alternative to measures like denying benefits to the aliens, as voters in California chose to do last month with Proposition 187.</p>
        <p>Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida called the court's decision today "only a temporary setback" and said the state planned to appeal.</p>
        <p>"I am committed to making sure that Floridians will not pay for the Federal Government's failure to enforce its own immigration laws," he said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The ruling comes as more than 20,000 Cuban refugees await word about their fate in American detention camps in Panama and at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.</p>
        <p>Most of those refugees were bound for Florida when the Clinton Administration, in a reversal of a longtime policy, decided in August to deny entry to Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro.</p>
        <p>More than 5,000 Haitian refugees are also detained in Guantanamo and want to enter the United States.</p>
        <p>In their lawsuit, Florida officials argued that the Federal Government had failed to fulfill its obligations to guard against illegal immigration and to deport such immigrants.</p>
        <p>In a report released last March, state officials estimated that illegal immigration cost Florida $884 million a year, primarily for education, social services and law enforcement.</p>
        <p>About 345,000 illegal immigrants live in the state, Florida officials said.</p>
        <p>Governor Chiles opposes cutting off services as Proposition 187 would do, and Judge Davis said in his decision that he agreed with Florida's argument that it faced "a Hobson's choice," or one that offers no choice.</p>
        <p>"If Florida chooses to not provide services to illegal aliens including closing schools, emergency rooms, etc., the impact on the health, safety and welfare of its citizenry could be potentially devastating," the judge said in his written decision. "If on the other hand Florida chooses to provide the services, the cost could cripple the state."</p>
        <p>There are efforts by some groups in Florida to push for measures similar to Proposition 187 in California, which requires teachers and clinic doctors to deny help to illegal immigrants and to report them to the police. The measure, which Californians approved 3 to 2, is under court review.</p>
        <p>In Texas, one of the six other states that have filed suit to gain compensation for some immigration-related costs, a Federal judge has said he was inclined to dismiss the suit and indicated relief should come from Congress instead.</p>
        <p>But Texas officials said they were optimistic that their arguments would prevail on appeal.</p>
        <p>"We believe strongly that the Constitution compels the Federal Government to reimburse the state," said Ward Tisdale, a spokesman for the Texas Attorney General's office. "We feel a judicial remedy is far preferable and more responsible than the extreme measures we've seen in other parts of the country."</p>
        <p>Florida officials said humanitarian Federal policies that had forced the state to absorb successive waves of political refugees from Cuba and other countries had also greatly strained resources in areas like education and health care. Governor Chiles argues that if those now held in detention camps are allowed into the United States they should have financial sponsorships and should relocate in other states.</p>
        <p>But Steve Forester, the supervising lawyer for the Haitian Refugee Center, contended that politics rather than cost ultimately determines which immigrants are acceptable. He cited the different treatment afforded to Cuban and Haitian children held in the detention camps -- unaccompanied Cuban minors have been allowed into the country but their Haitian counterparts have not -- and attributed it to the political clout of the Cuban-American community in Miami.</p>
        <p>"It has to do with domestic politics and the fact that the scapegoating of immigrants translates into votes," Mr. Forester said.</p>
        <p>On Monday, a Federal appeals court judge reversed a lower court ruling that would have allowed the roughly 230 Haitian children who have been in the camps since July to enter the country. Lawyers for the Government have argued that the Haitians, unlike the Cubans, can now return to a democratic homeland.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forester and others at the Haitian Refugee Center today called on Americans to appeal to Attorney General Janet Reno to parole the Haitian children into the United States.</p>
