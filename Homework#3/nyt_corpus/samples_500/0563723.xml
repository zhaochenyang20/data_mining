        <p>Here in the rolling hills just outside the Talladega National Forest, the leaves are beginning to turn, and so, it seems, are many of the Reagan Democrats.</p>
        <p>If enough of them vote Democratic in what was supposed to be the rock-solid Republican base, President Bush's re-election hopes could be doomed. "Clinton's for the common man; Bush is for the rich," said Roger Dunaway, a 43-year-old crane operator from nearby Coldwater who voted for Mr. Bush and Ronald Reagan in the past but seems to have nothing but disdain for Mr. Bush now. "It's time to get the Republicans out of there."</p>
        <p>For all but one of the past five Presidential elections, voters like Mr. Dunaway have been responsible for the surest thing in Presidential politics: the Republican stranglehold on the South that has seen the Democrats win only of the 11 old Confederacy states in one of the last three elections.</p>
        <p>This year enough voters have come back to the Democrats that virtually every Southern state is up for grabs for the first time since the last Democrat, Jimmy Carter, won the White House in 1976. Bush Needs All of the South</p>
        <p>President Bush is in enough trouble nationally that winning almost all the South this year would not guarantee his re-election. But failing to do it would almost certainly guarantee his defeat.</p>
        <p>That explains why Gov. Bill Clinton was campaigning today in Louisiana, which has gone Democratic once -- for Mr. Carter in 1976 -- since the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960. Now polls show the candidates to be evenly matched there.</p>
        <p>"The No. 1 strategic objective for the Republicans has to be a re-creation of an almost solid South," said Earl Black, a University of South Carolina political scientist. "If they can't do it, I don't see how they can find enough states to win."</p>
        <p>From 1880 to 1944 the South regularly voted as a solid Democratic bloc. But by the early 70's the South was becoming a Republican Presidential stronghold, and by the 1980's the Democrats could carry just one Southern state: Jimmy Carter's Georgia in 1980.</p>
        <p>This year, however, the South is the nation's most competitive region, including Texas with 32 electoral votes, Florida with 25, North Carolina with 14 and Georgia with 13. For the last eight years, all 11 states, with 27 percent of the nation's electoral votes, went Republican.</p>
        <p>"I keep pinching myself," said Al LaPierre, executive director of the Alabama Democratic Party, where Mr. Bush won 61 percent of the vote in 1988 and polls now show the race even. "It's been 16 years since we've come to the middle of October neck and neck. Usually, we're 17 points down." Economy Is No. 1 Issue</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush clearly stands a chance to win all the region, with the exception of Arkansas and perhaps Tennessee; that could salvage his campaign. But there is a fear among some Republicans that his lagging prospects nationally could compound his problems in the South, where the economy remains the dominant issue and the old value-laden issues that once dominated elections seem to have lost their punch.</p>
        <p>Not that it is hard to find Bush supporters in the South. Interviews with two dozen white voters at shopping malls Mississippi turned up only one solidly for Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>And in Alabama, many of those who have voted Republican in the past plan to do so again.</p>
        <p>"No way I'd vote for Clinton," said Bobby Miller, poking his head up from under the hood of a car he was working on at his service station here. "Some of his issues, abortion, defending homosexuals, may be O.K. for some people, but not for me."</p>
        <p>But here and across the South it is clear that the sour economy, Mr. Bush's political weaknesses, the all-Southern Democratic ticket and the ways in which the political arithmetic of the South can work against the Republicans are imperiling the Republican base. 'No Way I'd Vote for Bush'</p>
        <p>All seven of the people congregating near a string of antique and curio shops next to Cotton's produce stand here voted for Mr. Bush in 1988. They were in a majority of 72 percent of the white Alabama voters that year. Now one is firmly for Mr. Bush, one firmly for Mr. Clinton and another leaning that way, one for Ross Perot, one planning to vote for the Libertarian Party, one too disgusted to vote and one too confused to say what she will do.</p>
        <p>It is anything but the solid Republican South.</p>
        <p>"No way I'd vote for Bush," said Elizabeth Horn, who says she will not vote this year. "We've seen what Reagan and Bush have done. The butter's fallen off the biscuits."</p>
        <p>Interviews across the region indicate the problems may be particularly severe with women voters. Lisa Kety, a 31-year-old lawyer from Folsom, La., who voted for Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush in 1988, said she supported Mr. Clinton largely because of the Republican opposition to abortion rights.</p>
        <p>Like the rest of the nation, Mr. Bush is hurt most by the economy. But in the South there is an added kicker. The Republican dominance of the last 12 years has come in states where the Democrats generally dominate at the state level and where Republicans still have to fight the image of being the party of the wealthy. 'Hurting Economically'</p>
        <p>Natalie Davis, a political science professor at Birmingham Southern College, said 45 percent of the Reagan Democrats polled in Alabama said they were worse off today than four years ago, as against 31 percent of all voters.</p>
        <p>That poses a tough hurdle for any President. But some analysts say Mr. Bush, unlike Mr. Reagan, may not be the kind of Republican who can sell in the South during hard times.</p>
        <p>"The rural and small-town South is hurting economically, and who do they see in there?" said Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst. "Do they see a middle-class Nixon or Reagan? No, they see Mr. Pinstripes from Kennebunkport and Skull and Bones, who's the old Republican bogeyman."</p>
        <p>Also hurting the Republicans is the degree to which economic issues are trumping social ones in this election. In the past, value-laden issues played strongest in the South. This year, even though issues like Mr. Clinton's draft history probably do more for the Republicans in the South than elsewhere, few voters seem to mention the draft as a defining issue.</p>
        <p>Even race, the issue that in overt and subtle ways helped transform the South from solidly Democratic to solidly Republican, seems to be off the table.</p>
        <p>"I think the Rodney King thing probably blew any chance that they would try to make that an issue, because sometimes issues, even in a subliminal and subtle way, are too hot to handle," said Matt Towery, a Republican who is running unopposed for state representative in Cobb County outside Atlanta.  Factoring the Black Vote</p>
        <p>In fact, if race has helped create the new Republican South, this year may show that it can work for the Democrats as well.</p>
        <p>Despite the well-publicized squabbles between Mr. Clinton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, blacks seem solidly and often enthusiastically behind Mr. Clinton and and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, who are both typical of the Democratic moderates who run well in the South.</p>
        <p>In states like Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and Louisiana, where blacks can make up more than 30 percent of the electorate, a solid black vote for Mr. Clinton means Mr. Bush needs more than 60 percent of the white vote to win. To the extent Mr. Perot is a factor, he tends to help Mr. Clinton in the South by drawing white voters from Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>"If Clinton and Bush more or less divide the white vote, the Republicans have no hope," Professor Black said.</p>
        <p>Compounding the Republican weaknesses, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have run close to a perfect race for the South, blunting social issues like the death penalty and welfare and hitting hard on economic ones.</p>
        <p>"The key was nominating two moderate Southerners and distancing themselves a bit from Jesse Jackson and appealing to Reagan Democrats to come home," said William Barnard, a history professor at the University of Alabama. "It's worked."</p>
        <p>Still, the strength of the Democrats this year is really just enough to keep them in the game, not insured victories. Some supporters of Mr. Bush think the South is too conservative not to finally drift back to the Republicans.</p>
        <p>"I know what the polls say, but I think this will be like the Atlanta Braves game the other night," said Mr. Miller, the car mechanic. "It was hard to see how they were going to win, but they did."</p>
        <p>For now, in addition to Arkansas and Tennessee, the Clinton campaign is given its best chances in North Carolina, Georgia and perhaps Louisiana. The Republicans seem strongest in Mississippi and South Carolina, and are certain to throw everything they can at must-win states like Florida and Texas. The difference is the Democrats would be thrilled with a split of the South. The Republicans need to come close to wining it all.</p>
        <p>"I think this is like 1980, where, with the exception of Texas and Florida, where the Republicans won big, most of these states were very tight races," Professor Black said. "I could easily see all of these states going either way. I could see a sweep for Clinton or a sweep for Bush. But I think it's more likely at this point to be a sweep for Clinton."</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 25, 1992, Sunday</p>
        <p>A chart last Sunday about the Southern states' voting record in Presidential elections misidentified two Democratic nominees in some copies. The nominee in 1968 was Hubert H. Humphrey; in 1972 it was George McGovern.</p>
