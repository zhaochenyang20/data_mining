        <p>The Presidential voting in Moscow, Russia, was a certainty. But the Independence Day celebration in Moscow, Vt., is traditionally up in the air.</p>
        <p>People have been calling the Moscow General Store to find out whether there will be a parade on the Fourth of July.</p>
        <p>Alexander LeVeille, who owns the store with his wife, Sarah, has been noncommittal. "You never know until that day," he said on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The 200 residents of this hamlet hidden in the Green Mountains, just south of Stowe, pride themselves on their spontaneity. They wake up on July 4th and if the spirit moves them, they slap together a few floats, assemble on Tom Hamilton's front lawn around 10 A.M., march the 150 yards or so down Main Street, turn around, march back, and then disperse. For 19 straight years, the parade has just sort of happened.</p>
        <p>"There are no meetings, no planning," Mr. LeVeille said. The unofficial rules forbid it. No one is supposed to work on a float until the morning of the Fourth of July.</p>
        <p>And, Mr. LeVeille, who wrapped his backhoe in red, white and blue crepe paper and drove it in last year's parade, said, "You do not spend more than $50 on a float." There is no winning float, of course.</p>
        <p>Politicians are not invited. There is no grand marshal and no marching band.  The people of Moscow tune their radios to WDEV, out of Waterbury, and every year, on the assumption that the parade will go on, the station broadcasts about 30 minutes of marching music, starting at 10 A.M.</p>
        <p>Still, after 19 parades it is hard to be entirely spontaneous. On Tuesday evening, Moscow's fabled All Ladies Lawn Chair Drill Team got together at Jane Christopherson's house to drink wine and -- in flagrant violation of the rules -- practice a few moves across the lawn. "We are in deep trouble," Jan Kilburn said.</p>
        <p>The 13 women, some of whom are in their 60's, were decked out in last year's  parade uniforms -- Hawaiian shirts, shorts, baseball caps and sunglasses. Ms. Christopherson, a onetime co-captain of the Burlington High School majorettes, had on her gold-lame Wiggins Co-op Inc. cap.</p>
        <p>The women assembled in haphazard rows with their aluminum and plastic webbed  folding chairs -- except for Rudi Hamilton, who carried her folding-made-in-Vermont-wooden chair, as she does every year. On the count of eight, the women twirled the chairs around their waists, raised them above their heads, opened and shut them several times -- clack, clack, clack -- and sat on the chairs with their legs crossed for eight beats.</p>
        <p>"We've got it down this year," Ms. Christopherson said.</p>
        <p>They repeated the routine several times. Mike Sheehy, who is a member of the  Moscow All-Men's Radio Marching Band, took pictures. As far as anyone knows, the men's marching band has never once practiced.</p>
        <p>The women's practice lasted all of 10 minutes. The women hung around for a while, reminiscing about how the parade began. "The first year there were 25 people," said Mrs. Hamilton, who, with her husband, Ed, helped organize it.</p>
        <p>"There were no spectators," Nancy Stead said.</p>
        <p>Last year more than 1,000 people from surrounding communities showed up.</p>
        <p>The Moscow parade goes with laid-back Vermont. Since there are no police officers to block off the street, traffic can be a problem. Anyone who happens to drive down Main Street between 10 and 10:30 that morning ends up in the parade.</p>
        <p>Two years ago the women's lawn chair drill team was invited to march in nearby Morrisville's parade, an hour later than Moscow's. They all piled in Jane Christopherson's van for the trip, but when they got there, they decided not to  march.</p>
        <p>"It looked like it was going to be miles and miles," Barbara Williams said.</p>
        <p>Anne Lusk was on her porch Tuesday afternoon, fashioning a badminton net into the "Moscow Internet" for her float. Yes, she was cheating. Ms. Lusk, who marched as a Holstein cow last year, cheats every year by starting on her float  two days early.</p>
        <p>At the general store, Mr. LeVeille and his wife said they were thinking of building a float for 79-year-old Evelyn Ayers, who sorts the mail at the post office, which is in the general store.</p>
        <p>"She's going to be queen of the parade," Mrs. LeVeille said.</p>
        <p>But the LeVeilles have not breathed a word of their plan to Mrs. Ayers, who usually is a spectator at the parade. And on Tuesday, Mrs. Ayers was busy packing. After 79 years in Moscow, she is planning to move to Craftsbury, 25 miles north, to live with her daughter.</p>
        <p>Is she planning to go to the parade? "If I don't forget," she said.</p>
