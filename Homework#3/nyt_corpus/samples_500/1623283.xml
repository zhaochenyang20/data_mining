        <p>An article on Sunday about a State Senate race by an incumbent who gave up her Democratic affiliation two years ago misstated her current party alignment. The legislator, Olga A. Mendez, whose district includes parts of the Bronx and Manhattan, is running on the Republican and Independence Party lines, not just as a Republican. In some copies the article also misstated the timing of a news conference at which Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton endorsed Ms. Mendez's Democratic opponent, City Councilman José Marco Serrano. It was made two weeks ago, not last week.</p>
