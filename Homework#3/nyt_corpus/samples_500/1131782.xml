        <p>The numerals are Roman, but the food is Argentine. LX, on East 60th Street in Manhattan, is a dark and handsome newcomer that goes beyond the gaucho-steak formula to explore regional Argentine specialties.</p>
        <p>Carlos Benavides, the chef, is from Buenos Aires, and he uses the empanada as his culinary soapbox, changing the ingredients constantly to showcase a different style or region of Argentina.</p>
        <p>Last week, for example, he reached out to the northwestern province of San Luis for a stuffing of grilled chicken, red and green peppers, Argentine chorizo, raisins and green olives.</p>
        <p>Argentine chorizo, sweeter and milder than its Spanish cousin, figures prominently in a delicious soup of pureed asparagus with crunchy slices of hearts of palm. The tamal de Tucuman is a whopper, thick walled and blunt, with a stuffing of veal, raisins, bell peppers and squash puree.</p>
        <p>There's an Argentine ribeye steak, of course, but I preferred the generous skirt steak, fanned around half a large plate and served with a fresh green chimichurri sauce and a spicy sun-dried-tomato relish. Best bets among the desserts are the coconut flan and the irresistible crepes, filled with dulce de leche and cream cheese.</p>
        <p>Up front, where the doors open onto the sidewalk, LX looks like a dozen other Manhattan cafes. In back, however, it feels like a private railway car from the last century, with lustrous mahogany walls and dainty shaded wall lamps.</p>
        <p>The film posters are a nice touch: Argentine advertisements for schlocky Hollywood films from the 1940's and 50's, like ''Jungle Siren,'' with Ann Corio.</p>
        <p>LX, 45 East 60th Street, Manhattan; (212) 421-1234. Dinner entrees, $19 to $29.</p>
