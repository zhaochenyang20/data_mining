      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Her book, a stinging indictment of drug-tainted political corruption in Colombia, was a sensation this year in France, where she became known as Madame Colombia. The magazine Nouvel Observateur called Ingrid Betancourt the warrior of the Andes while the newspaper Libération described her as a heroine at war with cocaine kingpins.</p>
        <p>With the book, ''The Rage in My Heart,'' now being released in Colombia, intensive coverage might be expected here, too. After all, the Colombian press loves exploring the lives of Colombians who have found fame or fortune abroad, from the novelist Gabriel García Márquez to race-car drivers to the latest sizzling fashion model.</p>
        <p>What better subject than Ms. Betancourt? Youthful and charismatic, she is a former congresswoman and senator who won widespread support here for denouncing corrupt colleagues and the graft-ridden administration of a former president, Ernesto Samper, whose election campaign was accused of taking money from drug traffickers. That Ms. Betancourt's book is to be released in the United States by HarperCollins on Jan. 7 might be expected to generate further interest.</p>
        <p>But last week, as Ms. Betancourt embarked on a publicity campaign, the news media was strangely silent. No reviews in the leading newspaper, El Tiempo. No television cameras at her door.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Betancourt, 39, daughter of a former Unesco ambassador to Paris and a Colombian congresswoman, the indifference is emblematic of a country where corruption is the norm -- but few are willing to make denunciations.</p>
        <p>''Corruption is not abstract; it has a face, and it has a name and we have to say it,'' said Ms. Betancourt, who wears well-tailored business suits and appears a decade younger than her age. ''Corruption must be consciously confronted, and has to be on the conscience of all Colombians so that we cannot be manipulated.''</p>
        <p>To her detractors, such talk is self-serving drivel aimed at garnering votes and selling books, at both of which she has succeeded quite well.</p>
        <p>''I do not recognize her moral authority to judge any Colombian,'' said Senator Marta Catalina Daniels. ''This is the easy way to become popular, attacking people and carrying out this moral terrorism.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, though many Colombian blame institutional corruption for the country's unending civil unrest, Ms. Betancourt's style of in-your-face accusations does not sit well here.</p>
        <p>''We are a society that likes to ignore,'' said Santiago Vásquez, a political scientist. ''So many people do not like that style, and so they treat her like she is crazy.''</p>
        <p>But her unorthodox methods of calling attention to corruption have also made her a household name. In her successful run for congress in 1994, she passed out condoms on street corners -- symbolic protection against rampant corruption -- and in 1998 she drew a record number of votes to win a senate seat.</p>
        <p>As a congresswoman she went on a hunger strike to call for an independent inquiry against former President Samper. (Congress cleared him of the charges anyway.)</p>
        <p>Such tactics have not left her without enemies. Her persistence led to death threats against her and her family, forcing her in 1996 to send her children to live outside of Colombia with their father.</p>
        <p>''The people who are in power do not care for me one bit,'' said Ms. Betancourt, who travels with as many as a dozen bodyguards at all times. ''There are a lot of people who have an interest that people not know what is really happening in Colombia.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Betancourt said she tried at first to get her book published in Colombia, but was rejected by publishers.</p>
        <p>A French publisher became interested after hearing about Ms. Betancourt's travails. She was asked to write her story in French for XO Editions, which she did while living here. A legal challenge by former President Samper failed to stop publication, but succeeded in generating intense news coverage in France, where the book was released in March. Ms. Betancourt was feted by the press and the literary world.</p>
        <p>It helped that she had lived in France years ago before returning in 1990, speaks flawless French, and was educated at the exclusive Liceo Francés in Bogotá and later the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris. Her two children, Mélanie, 16, and Lorenzo, 13, are products of her first marriage, to a French diplomat.</p>
        <p>But the French were entranced by her book -- a biography tracing her comfortable upbringing and then her transformation into a corruption fighter who faced numerous death threats. It spent 13 weeks as a best seller and was No. 1 for four of those weeks, selling 120,000 copies.</p>
        <p>HarperCollins is now hoping that the book -- to be published in English under the title, ''Until Death Do Us Part: My Struggle to Reclaim Colombia'' -- will find similar success in the United States.</p>
        <p>In Colombia, however, there was clear discomfort with a Colombian airing the country's dirty laundry abroad. Semana, Colombia's leading newsmagazine, portrayed Ms. Betancourt as Joan of Arc, saying that in her book ''practically all'' Colombians ''are bad, except for her.''</p>
        <p>But that was eight months ago.  One magazine here, Cambio, ran a small item this week noting that her ''proselytizing activities'' received  more coverage in the foreign press.</p>
        <p>The indifference, though, did not seem to bother dozens of book buyers who swarmed around Ms. Betancourt last week as she went from one book signing to another. Many buyers, shaking her hand or kissing her cheek, expressed disgust with the country's politicians.</p>
        <p>''I'm tired of being deceived,'' said one buyer, J. Orlando Rodríguez, as he greeted Ms. Betancourt. ''I like your ideas. Do not deceive me.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Betancourt, holding his hands, smiled and said, ''I would never deceive you.''</p>
