        <p>I'M sticky, sticky, sticky with patches. There's a bright blue one on my wrist, ''impregnated with the oil of a tropical orchid,'' in the words of its inventor, a chef in Ilkley, England. If I take little sniffs of it, the maker promises, I won't want to eat anything sweet.</p>
        <p>I've had patches like tiny plaster casts over the bridge of my nose and bean-shape patches under my eyes. I've tried patches intended to destroy blemishes and some for spider veins and for muscle pain. It's all very ''Gattaca,'' I think -- very medical and modern and millennial -- and part of a trendlet rippling through the cosmetics industry. Patches are the latest gimmick, and maybe even the latest metaphor for how we think about our bodies, ourselves.</p>

        <p>I'M sticky, sticky, sticky with patches. There's a bright blue one on my wrist, ''impregnated with the oil of a tropical orchid,'' in the words of its inventor, a chef in Ilkley, England. If I take little sniffs of it, the maker promises, I won't want to eat anything sweet.</p>
        <p>I've had patches like tiny plaster casts over the bridge of my nose and bean-shape patches under my eyes. I've tried patches intended to destroy blemishes and some for spider veins and for muscle pain. It's all very ''Gattaca,'' I think -- very medical and modern and millennial -- and part of a trendlet rippling through the cosmetics industry. Patches are the latest gimmick, and maybe even the latest metaphor for how we think about our bodies, ourselves.</p>
        <p>Not all patches do the same thing or work the same way. Most popular are Biore's Pore Perfect Strips. Perhaps you've seen the advertisement for them, which is riveting, in a bilious way. A young woman sports a strip patch over the bridge of her nose (a reference, perhaps, to the nose-job sight gag in the movie ''Clueless''?). Time passes. The heroine slowly, primly, peels off the strip. ''It unclogs pores by lifting out dirt, makeup, even blackheads'' -- she says, wincing slightly -- ''which you can see on the strip when you're done, if you like looking at that sort of thing.''</p>
        <p>The strips, $5.99 for a package of six, have been perfectly marketed; the company has held ''strip offs'' at malls and gave them away at last summer's Lilith Fair. Teen-age girls went gaga. According to a Nielsen survey, Biore was the best-selling skin-care product of 1997.</p>
        <p>Even grown-ups were fascinated. ''I got as far as Duane Reade,'' said one stylish friend of mine, who wanted to give them a try. ''But I'd just had a little work done on my nose and I thought, Hmmm, better skip it.''</p>
        <p>I was less prudent. For my trouble, I suffered greatly when I removed the strip, which also removed all the little hairs on my nose. It did not, however, remove any ''stalagmites,'' as Richard Maksimoski, Biore's director of research and development, so carefully phrased it in a telephone chat. Ponds has recently begun selling a copycat strip; a new advertisement features a J. Crewlike gaggle of women pulling off strips and bonding over the results.</p>
        <p>Less ruthless in intent are patches meant to deliver herbs and vitamins into the bloodstream through the skin. Now this is modern. It seems culturally appropriate to wear your medicine. A patch says, ''This is a health thing, not a vanity thing.''</p>
        <p>Infusia makes patches with Vitamin C for wrinkles ($26 for a box of 60), Vitamin K for broken capillaries, Saint Johnswort for muscle soreness and a cocktail of herbs and salicylic acid for blemishes. Another company, University Medical, makes a C patch in its Face Lift line, which is sold in drugstore chains, $9.95 for eight patches. Osmotics sells C patches called Derms at Saks, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, $125 for a packet of 48.</p>
        <p>''This is breakthrough stuff,'' said Steve Porter, a co-owner of Osmotics, maintaining that his patches work because they're left on for a long time. ''There have been studies on transdermal deliveries,'' he said, ''that concluded that the outer layer of the skin, which does its job by keeping things out, will, after a couple of hours of being occluded, or blocked, relax and start letting things in.'' Things like Vitamin C, this week's new-old wonder treatment for wrinkles.</p>
        <p>The patches are appealing, in a clinical sort of way. The Osmotics Derms are clear, like invisible tape, and they're meant to be worn overnight or at least six hours. I applied them gleefully. Tap. Tap. One along each cheekbone. I thought: They cost a lot of money. They look so medical. Magic will be done tonight.</p>
        <p>But the next day, it was Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! You're supposed to work the Derms off with oil that the company supplies, and I carefully mushed oil under them, as instructed, peeling back the edges ever so gently. But I had angry red swaths where the patches had been. I still had crow's-feet, but now I had chapped crow's-feet. Not a good look.</p>
        <p>Patchwork, patch job. The wordplay the new patches inspire feels appropriate to the way some scientific experts feel about claims of the beauty industry.</p>
        <p>Dr. John Bailey, director of the Office of Cosmetics and Colors at the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the cosmetics industry, said: ''This is a play on consumer perception. They know about the nicotine patch, and they say, 'Aha.' But there's no way of assessing the benefits in an unbiased way. We don't test them, and therefore you have to rely on the word of the company. You could take Saran Wrap and wind it around yourself, or cover yourself in Vaseline, and this will cause the skin to plump up for a short while. Is that a meaningful benefit?''</p>
        <p>I don't know. I think the patches are kind of fun, and a testimony to niche marketing; there's something appealing about breaking the face into bits in this way: eye patch, nose patch, neck patch. Like the decorative patches worn in earlier centuries -- vanity's response to smallpox scars -- the new patches could evolve as a sign language telegraphing political or sexual messages.</p>
        <p>''What is a patch?'' asked George Ledes, publisher and editor of Beauty/Fashion, a trade publication, and another skeptic. ''It's all been delivered in creams before, and now -- what? Your hands don't get dirty?''</p>
        <p>I love the Diet Scent patch (out in Britain  and coming soon, via infomercial, to a cable channel near you). ''You hide it up your sleeve,'' said Liz Paul, the English chef who invented it, ''and you take a big sniff whenever you are in the supermarket, and it stops you eating all those naughty things.'' The vanilla smell is faint, and I don't know if it works, but there's no denying that the bright blue patch looks marvelous.</p>
        <p>Ms. Paul also makes a Love Patch. It's cranberry colored, and smells like cinnamon. It's supposed to mimic pheromones, those olfactory come-ons. Just take a sniff, and you want all those naughty things.</p>
        <p>Speaking of fetishes, my friend Kim has been using a nicotine patch for about six months (more than three times the recommended length), and she says she's going to stay on it forever. ''Look, it's a life-style choice,'' she said. ''I need something transgressive in my life, and at this point it's either this patch or a tattoo.''</p>
        <p>How about a tattoo of a patch?  VIEW</p>
