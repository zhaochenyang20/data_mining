        <p>A judge has struck down a pesticide notification law in Nassau County after finding that the county failed to perform a required environmental impact study.</p>
        <p>The ruling, by Justice Stephen A. Bucaria of State Supreme Court in Mineola, nullified a unanimous vote by the county Legislature last year to enforce the law beginning March 1 of this year.</p>
        <p>The state law, designed to take effect only in counties that elect to participate, requires that commercial pesticide applicators give neighbors 48 hours' advanced notice before spraying residential properties.</p>
        <p>The decision, on April 11, was a setback for breast cancer groups and environmental organizations that lobbied for eight years to gain passage of the state law.</p>
        <p>John Zaher, a spokesman for the county executive's office, said no decision had been made on an appeal.</p>
        <p>''The costs will be passed on to consumers, and some will apply pesticides themselves rather than pay the higher costs,'' Frederick Eisenbud, the lawyer for a tree-spraying company that brought the suit, said about pesticide notification. He noted the law also exempted governments, agriculture, golf courses and property owners.</p>
        <p>Backers of the law said it allowed people to take precautions, like bringing children, pets and outdoor furniture inside, before spraying occurred next door.</p>
