        <p>Angered by a bipartisan deal on judicial nominees, many Senate Republicans warned on Tuesday that they were already eager to challenge the agreement by pushing forward contested candidates, as the Senate cleared the way for the confirmation of the first Bush choice to benefit from the deal.</p>

        <p>Angered by a bipartisan deal on judicial nominees, many Senate Republicans warned on Tuesday that they were already eager to challenge the agreement by pushing forward contested candidates, as the Senate cleared the way for the confirmation of the first Bush choice to benefit from the deal.</p>
        <p>''This deal is really no deal until it plays out at length,'' said Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, who said he wanted a vote soon after Memorial Day on the nomination of William G. Myers III, a candidate whose fate was left uncertain in the deal.</p>
        <p>Just a day after the agreement broke an impasse that had vexed the Senate and the Bush administration for years, senators on both sides of the aisle portrayed the new framework as fragile. Republicans in particular said the bipartisan deal, brokered by seven Democrats and seven Republicans on the eve of a showdown that could have crippled the Senate, would survive only if Democrats refrained from filibustering other emerging nominees, including some who were not guaranteed a vote in the last-minute agreement.</p>
        <p>Other Republicans threatened to immediately invoke what some have called the nuclear option -- doing away with the filibuster against judicial candidates -- if Democrats tried to block any nominee except in the most extreme cases.</p>
        <p>''This is merely a truce; it's not a treaty yet,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.</p>
        <p>Some leading Republicans also expressed concern about an understanding among the majority of Democrats who signed the agreement that they would agree to block two other nominees backed by Mr. Bush: Brett M. Kavanaugh and William J. Haynes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kavanaugh is staff secretary to Mr. Bush, and the White House was alarmed that his confirmation prospects were not enhanced by the agreement.</p>
        <p>''We will continue to press for fair up-or-down votes for all nominees,'' said Bob Stevenson, a spokesman for Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader.</p>
        <p>Democratic lawmakers and senior aides said they had assurances from six of the seven Democrats who participated in reaching the agreement that Mr. Haynes and Mr. Kavanaugh -- who at one point had been named specifically in the agreement but were dropped in later drafts -- would be opposed.</p>
        <p>''We feel we have a strong commitment from our colleagues that Kavanaugh and Haynes will not go forward,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No.2 Democrat.</p>
        <p>The compromise did lead on Wednesday to an 81-to-18 vote to cut off debate on the nomination of Justice Priscilla R. Owen, a Texas Supreme Court member whose nomination has been blocked for four years.</p>
        <p>''I appreciate the fact that I'm finally going to get a vote, thanks to your votes,'' Justice Owen said at the White House, where she joined President Bush, Dr. Frist and both Texas senators, who have called for the Senate to act on the nomination.</p>
        <p>She is expected to be confirmed at noon Wednesday, allowing the Senate to turn to another contentious nomination, that of John R. Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Republicans were not alone in their discontent with the new deal. The Congressional Black Caucus, which had joined Senate Democrats in the effort to retain the filibuster, criticized Senate Democrats for agreeing to allow votes on two other nominees -- Justice Janice Rogers Brown, who is black, and William Pryor -- who had records that caucus members considered hostile to civil rights laws.</p>
        <p>''This deal is more of a capitulation than a compromise,'' said Representative Melvin Watt, Democrat of North Carolina and the caucus chairman.</p>
        <p>Architects of the deal in both parties acknowledged it was not perfect, but they said it provided an avenue for the Senate to get beyond the judicial fighting that has taken over the agenda.</p>
        <p>''We've all suffered in the eyes of the public,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a signatory to the pact. ''So it's a chance to start over.''</p>
        <p>Under the pact ironed out in weeks of negotiations between a shifting cast of Senate characters, seven Democrats agreed to filibuster judicial nominees only in ''extraordinary'' circumstances. In exchange, seven Republicans said they would not support any change in Senate rules to bar filibusters against judicial nominees unless Democrats reneged.</p>
        <p>Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said he viewed the agreement as ending the threat by Dr. Frist to prohibit filibusters.</p>
        <p>''It took the nuclear option off the table,'' Mr. Reid said. ''The nuclear option is gone for our lifetime.''</p>
        <p>Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that he shared Mr. Reid's view and that the Senate had narrowly averted a crisis.</p>
        <p>''It does seem to me that the American people want us to get on with the people's business,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''This has been an enormous distraction.''</p>
        <p>At the White House, President Bush credited Dr. Frist with forcing the issue in a way that led to a vote for Justice Owen. ''She is my friend, and more importantly, she's a great judge,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>While Republicans said they did not view the compromise as barring a future vote on rules changes, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said it should allow Republicans to speed about a half-dozen stalled nominees to the federal bench, with new nominations expected soon from the White House.</p>
        <p>Senate leaders took steps Tuesday night to allow votes on three less contentious judicial candidates after the coming holiday break: David W. McKeague, Richard A. Griffin and Thomas B. Griffith. Mr. Reid said he believed Democrats would also agree to a vote on Susan Bieke Neilson.</p>
        <p>It was uncertain when the Senate might take up the nominations of Justice Brown and Mr. Pryor, who along with Justice Owen were cleared in the compromise. The agreement specifically made no commitment for lawmakers to agree to limit debate on Mr. Myers or Henry Saad, another appeals court nominee.</p>
        <p>Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a Democratic leader of the negotiations, said he personally did not intend to support a filibuster of Mr. Myers, saying the outcome of such a vote would be in the hands of the individual lawmakers who agreed to the compromise.</p>
        <p>That uncertainty surrounding the Myers nomination and a handful of others had some lawmakers viewing the compromise as simply a stopgap, particularly if a Supreme Court vacancy occurs.</p>
        <p>''I think it leaves the door wide open for a major blowup down the road,'' said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota.</p>
