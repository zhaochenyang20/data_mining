        <p>The Jets have lived with insults for so long, surely another barrage couldn't faze them.</p>
        <p>But today, the New England Patriots taunted them so much -- daring the Jets' defenders again and again to stop them on fourth down -- that it turned into a cause. And the Jets are a club that seems to need a cause.</p>
        <p>So in a screaming, shouting and shoving match against a division rival, the Jets halted the Pats when it mattered, then ran over them on offense and produced a 24-17 victory.</p>
        <p>For just a few moments after the game, the Jets even thought they were tied for first place in the A.F.C. East when someone erroneously told them the Dolphins had lost. First place? The Jets haven't been there this late since 1986.</p>
        <p>But even with Miami's overtime victory against the Raiders, the Jets are tied for second in the division with the Bills at 4-3. It isn't a bad place to be with a bye week coming up, and two straight victories to reflect on, and time to get an injured quarterback healed.</p>
        <p>In the National Football League, when a team goes for it on fourth down, and it still is early in the game, it is something of an insult to the enemy defense.</p>
        <p>"It's telling us: 'We don't think you can stop us,' " said linebacker Bobby Houston. "We were talking about it among ourselves. Then right before the plays, we were shouting at them."</p>
        <p>The Patriots, under the direction of Coach Bill Parcells, went for it eight times on fourth down. The teams had a 4-4 standoff, including an offside by Ronnie Lott that led to a first down and officially doesn't count as a Patriots fourth-down attempt.</p>
        <p>But the seven official attempts equal the most ever tried in one game since the Elias Sports Bureau began keeping track of the the statistic 20 years ago. Who had the seven? The Jets, who converted three of the attempts in a game against San Francisco two years ago.</p>
        <p>Lott knew those in-your-face calls would be coming, though.</p>
        <p>"We expected them," he said. "It's Bill Parcells. It's his style." It's a style Parcells employs because he has a young gem of a quarterback, Drew Bledsoe. But the Jets' defense had plans for him today. Under the orchestration of defensive coordinator Greg Robinson, they blitzed the young man with the golden arm. And blitzed and blitzed, sacking him three times in all.</p>
        <p>"We just had to come up with ways to keep him from getting the ball," explained Robinson. And while Bledsoe threw it 41 times, he barely completed half his passes, and usually not for big yardage.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Johnny Johnson produced the kind of game that negates fourth-down attempts. The versatile Jets runner finally sprung loose on important first-down runs after what has been an erratic season. Seven times he dashed for 7 or more yards on first-and-10. Four times he amassed 12 or more yards. That made life so much simpler for Boomer Esiason, who still has a sprained left ankle.</p>
        <p>Over all, Johnson finished with 122 yards on 21 carries. On first down, he was even more impressive: 93 yards on 13 attempts.</p>
        <p>But Johnson is a low-key athlete, and he declined to talk to the news media afterward.</p>
        <p>"I don't want to look like a front-runner," he said to a member of the front office. In a happy clubhouse, he remained in the trainer's room with a towel around his waist, sipping a cup of coffee.</p>
        <p>Johnson hadn't been slated to be a one-man show today. The Jets had hoped that Adrian Murrell, their potentially dangerous big-play runner, would carry a dozen times or more and spark the running game. Instead, Murrell was injured in the first quarter and is expected to be out from four to six weeks with a sprained right knee.</p>
        <p>Still, Johnson's strong day might be a signal that the Jets have altered their San Francisco-style attack and gone back to their cold-weather roots. Call it East Coast meat and potatoes instead of West Coast quiche.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the Pats don't seem to be in that grind-it-out mold, although they did get a big game out of former Jet Blair Thomas.</p>
        <p>Going into today's game, he had carried twice all season while being hobbled with a bad ankle.</p>
        <p>The former first-round pick, whose ineffective four-year career here symbolized the struggles of the Jets' Bruce Coslet-Dick Steinberg regime, made a surprising return to Giants Stadium. Shaking off boos, he produced a touchdown, and over all, rushed for 63 yards on 14 carries.</p>
        <p>But as good as Thomas was, it was the Jets' rushing attack that was dominant today, with Brad Baxter picking up 38 yards in 12 attempts to go along with Johnson's effort. Finally, the Jets seem to have their runners in rhythm, with their offensive line playing up to its ability.</p>
        <p>"This was a transition in our style a little bit," Coach Pete Carroll conceded. "We feel good running the football."</p>
        <p>They must have from the first play of the game, when Johnson roared up the middle for 16 yards. At the same time, it was the defense and special teams that ultimately put the ball in position for the Jets to win. Three of the Jets' scores followed turnovers, including a fumble recovery by Lott, who had a spectacular timing sack of Bledsoe on fourth down late in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>And Hasty, who has felt abused by the news media since he was burned for a touchdown by Denver's John Elway in Game 2, let his emotion out by running 30 yards to the edge of the stands after he sacked Bledsoe on a key fourth-down play in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>The Jets had been thinking about Bledsoe all week. Their assignment: get to the guy who averages 47 passes a game. Bledsoe helped the Jets on his very first snap, which he fumbled, turning the ball over to Lott on the Jets' 11. Three plays letter, Baxter scored from the 1.</p>
        <p>New England produced its own touchdown after Esiason was sacked (one of six times he went down) and fumbled. That led to a Bledsoe-to-Ray Crittenden scoring pass, on fourth down from the Jets' 3. Before the half, the Jets went ahead, 21-7, on Baxter's second rushing touchdown -- 2 yards -- and a 4-yard pass from Esiason to Johnny Mitchell.</p>
        <p>But on a Thomas-dominated drive that ended with his touchdown from 4 yards out, the Pats cut the edge to 21-14 in the fourth quarter only to see Nick Lowery connect from 37 yards for the Jets after Hasty's fourth-down sack of Bledsoe. Matt Bahr's late 40-yard field goal again put the Patriots 7 points away, but the Jets recovered his onside kick in the closing seconds.</p>
        <p>Thus, the Jets finished half their home season with a 3-1 record, heard the cheers of more than 71,000 fans and maybe even can remember that on Saturday night, at a dinner honoring the club's most valuable players of the past, they were given enough inspiration to last a season.</p>
        <p>For now, the Jets can concentrate on the present, even the future. For many, it's about time. EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The starting right tackle, SIUPELI MALAMALA, suffered a sprained knee.</p>
