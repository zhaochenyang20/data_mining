        <p>DEAR Diary:</p>
        <p>After a semester in Italy, my son returned to Manhattan last June for an internship and his senior year at New York University. He rented a studio in the East Village, so I loaded his things in a van and drove up from our home in Raleigh, N.C.</p>
        <p>Arriving at 5 p.m. on a Friday, I was delighted to find an open space right in front of his building.</p>

        <p>DEAR Diary:</p>
        <p>After a semester in Italy, my son returned to Manhattan last June for an internship and his senior year at New York University. He rented a studio in the East Village, so I loaded his things in a van and drove up from our home in Raleigh, N.C.</p>
        <p>Arriving at 5 p.m. on a Friday, I was delighted to find an open space right in front of his building.</p>
        <p>Sitting on the stoop was a neighbor enjoying tall-boy Budweisers wrapped in paper bags. Two of them. His eyes said they weren't his first two, either. As we unloaded the van, we had to climb over and around him repeatedly. He would stand, but not desert his roost. Although he did not voice his annoyance, his body language said as much each time he staggered to his feet.</p>
        <p>Before living in the South for 30 years, I might have suggested that he move so we could have easier access. But I didn't. It took an hour to ferry everything into the apartment.</p>
        <p>Over the weekend, rather than surrender the parking space, we walked to the Astor Place Kmart several times, bringing back a microwave, a bookshelf and other items. Each return found the neighbor on the stoop, enjoying his favorite beverage. Each trip inside required us to climb over and around him.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, with all necessary items unpacked, we took the empty boxes to the trash bins. In the hallway stood our friend, now somewhat sober. Spotting us, he asked, ''Youse movin' in?''</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>On a trip to visit my parents in suburban Arizona earlier this year, I embarked on Sunday morning to find a copy of the Sunday Times. After stopping at a diner, several minimarts and a couple of supermarkets, I was ready to give up and head back when I decided to make one last stop at the local branch of a national drugstore chain.</p>
        <p>''Excuse me,'' I said to the woman at the counter. ''Do you have today's New York Times?''</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure,'' she responded. ''Hey,'' she barked at her colleague at the photo lab. ''Do we have The New York Times?''</p>
        <p>Her co-worker looked at her somewhat quizzically, and said, ''Uh, I think it's three hours ahead.''</p>
        <p>I found the newspaper at the gas station across the street.</p>
        <p>Laura Heymann</p>
        <p>Overheard by Matthew Baigell at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, a New Yorker explaining to an out-of-towner how to cross the street:</p>
        <p>''A red light means look before you cross. A green light means looking is optional.''</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Proof that the subway will confuse everyone at some point.</p>
        <p>My sister Barbara was on the downtown F train when she heard this announcement from the conductor:</p>
        <p>''Broadway-Lafayette next stop. Transfer for the B, D or V train. Also transfer for the 6 train, downtown only. Reason:'' -- dramatic pause -- ''Unknown.''</p>
        <p>Judy Ross</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Recently, since I had been early dropping off Andrew, my 4-year-old, at his nursery school, I sat with him while he began to do puzzles that required him to match groups of pictured objects to their corresponding numbers. As he completed them, he sorted them, first in chronological sequence, then rearranged them so that the even numbers were together -- two, four, six, eight.</p>
        <p>Amazed, I asked his teacher, ''Are you teaching odd and even numbers?'' Steven, my first grader, was just learning to identify them.</p>
        <p>After she indicated no, I turned back to my son as he asked me, ''Where's the who?''</p>
        <p>''Who?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, who. You know -- two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate? Yankees, Yankees.''</p>
        <p>My genius no more.</p>

        <p>Nothing enlivens the taste buds like new and unusual ingredients added to longtime favorites, as Marcie S. Gitlin discovered while perusing the takeout menu of an Upper East Side Moroccan restaurant:</p>
        <p>''Toast Salad: Lettuce, Cucumber, Tomato, Carrots and Mescaline.''</p>
        <p>''At $10.95,'' she wrote, ''you won't want to toss away this tasty high.''</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>I was having breakfast with my 6-year-old daughter, Annie, accompanied by background music from Frank Sinatra. When ''Night and Day'' came on, I told her that it was one of my favorites, but that I liked the Ella Fitzgerald version better.</p>
        <p>She looked up from her milk and said: ''Daddy, stop teasing. Elephants can't sing.''</p>
