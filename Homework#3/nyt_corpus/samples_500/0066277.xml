        <p>LEAD: DAVID EVANS, a businessman in Springdale, Ark., went shopping for jewelry recently as an anniversary present for his wife and eventually bought a pair of diamond earrings. But he realized right from the start that he had no expertise in judging the quality of diamonds, so he sought guidance from a specialist in the field.</p>
        <p>DAVID EVANS, a businessman in Springdale, Ark., went shopping for jewelry recently as an anniversary present for his wife and eventually bought a pair of diamond earrings. But he realized right from the start that he had no expertise in judging the quality of diamonds, so he sought guidance from a specialist in the field.</p>
        <p>''It's hard for someone who knows nothing about jewelry to make a choice, other than to know what looks good,'' Mr. Evans said. ''So I went to a store where I have been buying for 19 years because they guarantee that the jewelry is what it claims to be. Perhaps I do pay a little more for that recognition, but I like the confidence.''</p>
        <p>Meeting and dealing with a person behind the counter of a store who is knowledgeable, reputable and ethical is the hope of every consumer like Mr. Evans in the market for fine jewelry.</p>
        <p>''Laymen are sometimes fooled by ripoff artists in stores,'' said Lance Stein, a partner at Grand Central Jewelers, a long-established jewelry store in New York. ''So in those cases you're not getting what you're being told you're getting.''</p>
        <p>One of the ways to determine if you are getting full value when buying a diamond is by using what jewelers call the four ''C's'': carat, cut, color and clarity.</p>
        <p>Carat - a word derived from the carob seed - is the standard measurement for the weight of diamonds, other precious stones and semiprecious stones. One carat is divided into 100 points, so that a 10-point diamond weighs one-tenth of a carat.</p>
        <p>Most diamonds are cut with a full 58 facets, or small, polished plane surfaces, in shapes that include the brilliant, the pear and the oval. Single-cut diamonds, however, have only 17 facets.</p>
        <p>When checking the cut of a diamond, experts advise care, since some jewelers may display it under ''diamond lights'' - special illumination that distorts the amount of reflected light. A more accurate determination can be made when the stone is seen under standard fluorescent lighting.</p>
        <p>The best color for a diamond is no color at all, because it then acts as a prism that lets light pass through the stone and creates a rainbow effect. The color grading scale ranges from the D grade of colorless, usually the most expensive, to the Z grade of light yellow.</p>
        <p>As for clarity, the diamond should be viewed under 10-power magnification to determine if there are inclusions or blemishes, such as internal cracks and tiny bubbles. The clearest diamonds are called flawless or perfect, with the characterization ranging downward to those with the most imperfections and with eye-visible inclusions, called imperfect.</p>
        <p>Since the typical jewelry customer does not have a 10-power magnifying glass or more than a modicum of knowledge about the four ''C's,'' picking the right dealer is probably the key decision when embarking on a shopping expedition.</p>
        <p>A recommendation from a family member or friend could be the starting point, as could picking a jeweler belonging to the American Gem Society, a professional organization of jewelers who have agreed to meet certain standards and practices.</p>
        <p>''I would go to more than one store and say, 'I'm interested in a diamond for this purpose and have this much money to pay,' '' said William G. Underwood, president of the gem society. ''You should be shown items on both sides of your budget and told why the diamond is priced as it is.''</p>
        <p>The society awards titles, such as registered jeweler and certified gemologist, on an annual basis to jewelers who pass examinations. Someone designated a certified gemologist appraiser is considered qualified to offer appraisals of jewelry.</p>
        <p>Anyone about to buy a diamond would probably do well to have it appraised by an independent appraiser who is not associated with either the dealer selling it or a competitor of that dealer. One such gem-grading laboratory is the Gemological Institute of America.</p>
        <p>''There isn't a diamond in the world that's like another because they're made by nature,'' said Gerry Hansen, president of the Jewelry Industry Council. ''In this market, you get what you pay for.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hansen and other jewelry experts warn of the dangers that exist whenever individuals buy diamonds for investment purposes. Precious stones, they say, are more an investment in pleasure than a money-making instrument, especially when a quick sale is desired. The four-year slump in diamonds that lasted through the end of 1985 is an example of the difficulty faced by the average investor in deciding when to buy and when to sell investment diamonds.</p>
        <p>''In any resale business like this, there are markups from wholesale to retail,'' Mr. Hansen noted. ''The consumer buys the product at retail, but if you want to sell your diamond, a retailer will buy it at the wholesale price.''</p>
