        <p>The appointment of Lorin Maazel as the next music director of the New York Philharmonic has been interpreted with all the variations of a Rorschach test by musicians, composers, musicologists and others pondering the future of the American symphony orchestra in the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maazel, 70, who has conducted orchestras in Berlin, Vienna, Cleveland and Pittsburgh and who is now music director of the Symphony Orchestra of the Bavarian State Radio, will replace Kurt Masur, 73, in the 2002-03 season. His four-year contract will commit him to 10 weeks of subscription concerts in the first season and 14 weeks for the remaining three seasons.</p>

        <p>The appointment of Lorin Maazel as the next music director of the New York Philharmonic has been interpreted with all the variations of a Rorschach test by musicians, composers, musicologists and others pondering the future of the American symphony orchestra in the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maazel, 70, who has conducted orchestras in Berlin, Vienna, Cleveland and Pittsburgh and who is now music director of the Symphony Orchestra of the Bavarian State Radio, will replace Kurt Masur, 73, in the 2002-03 season. His four-year contract will commit him to 10 weeks of subscription concerts in the first season and 14 weeks for the remaining three seasons.</p>
        <p>To those who want to see American orchestras loosen their 19th-century European moorings, Mr. Maazel, an American who has spent much of his career on the other side of the Atlantic, is something of a throwback: an elderly conductor with extraordinary technical prowess, steeped in a venerable tradition but with no known passion for contemporary innovation.</p>
        <p>Others insist that Mr. Maazel is as American as he can be: that is, the product of a blend of traditions and cultures, whose commitment to excellence will do one of the country's premier orchestras proud.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't be happier that it is an American conductor,'' said the composer Ned Rorem. ''It is about time. France has French conductors; Germany has German conductors. We are the only ones with the inferiority complex that thinks that Europeans are better.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maazel is the first American to lead the New York Philharmonic since Leonard Bernstein stepped down in 1969 and only its third American conductor since the orchestra was established in 1842.</p>
        <p>But Kim Kowalke, a professor at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and president of the Kurt Weill Foundation for Music, said he saw Mr. Maazel as more of a European.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't come up on my screen as an American since he has spent so much of his career in Europe,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kowalke, an outspoken advocate for the advancement of a younger generation of American conductors and composers, said that Mr. Maazel's appointment -- coupled with the recent wooing of foreign conductors by other top American orchestras -- could be read like a sign on the door: ''Young American conductors need not apply.''</p>
        <p>But others argue that nationality has no place in the cosmopolitan world of music.</p>
        <p>''Who is an American, anyway?'' asked Leon Botstein, president of  Bard College and conductor of the American Symphony Orchestra, himself a naturalized American born in Switzerland. ''Do you have to wear a cowboy hat? Are you American if you are trained in America? What if you are an American trained in Paris? Who are you?''</p>
        <p>The notion that Americans are better conductors of American music is no more valid than the idea that only Russians can convey the essence of Tchaikovsky, Mr. Botstein said.</p>
        <p>Joseph W. Polisi, president of the Juilliard School, said that Mr. Maazel's American roots -- he was born outside of Paris to American parents, but grew up in Los Angeles -- would serve him well in New York.</p>
        <p>''Knowing American traditions will be extraordinarily important in terms of community outreach and in terms of repertoire,'' Mr. Polisi said. ''He will have the sensitivity of someone who has grown up in the American environment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maazel's technical virtuosity gets high praise everywhere. ''He is the most accomplished conductor from the technical point of view,'' Mr. Botstein said. ''He has no peer.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Maazel's job as music director will be not only to conduct the Philharmonic but also to provide it with a fresh artistic vision at a critical moment in its history.</p>
        <p>''I think the orchestra needs to figure out what it wants to be, and that is more crucial than choosing a music director,'' said Joseph Horowitz, an American historian of classical music, a consultant to several orchestras and the former director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>''One hates to prejudge a situation like this, but the fear it provokes is that this signifies more business as usual than the Philharmonic can artistically afford,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even fans of Mr. Maazel's conducting wonder how and where he will lead the orchestra artistically.</p>
        <p>''Does a music director at the age of 70 have the ability to innovate?'' Mr. Botstein asked. ''The question is whether Maazel has the interest and the vision to radically rethink the relationship of the orchestra and the community, which was Bernstein's great talent.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Botstein also recalled that, far from being embraced by the New York music establishment in his day, Bernstein ''was mocked, he was held in contempt, he was the show guy, the pop composer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It is a vicious misrepresentation of history to say that he was embraced by the city and the orchestra,'' Mr. Botstein added.</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Maazel will turn toward a more contemporary repertory is still unknown. Mr. Rorem remembered that 10 years ago, Mr. Maazel, a composer himself, conducted the Cleveland Symphony in ''Sun,'' a composition by Mr. Rorem for voice and orchestra.</p>
        <p>''I am interested in him insofar as he is interested in me, or rather me and the other men and women who are writing music, '' Mr. Rorem said. ''We will be lying in wait to see how much contemporary music he will play.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 7, 2001, Wednesday  An article last Wednesday about reactions to the appointment of Lorin Maazel as the next music director of the New York Philharmonic misstated the name of the first American orchestra he directed. It is the Cleveland Orchestra, not the Cleveland Symphony.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the time elapsed since Mr. Maazel conducted that orchestra in Ned Rorem's ''Sun,'' a work for voice and orchestra. It was in 1979, not 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>The article also referred incompletely to Mr. Maazel's childhood residences. He was born in Paris to American parents and grew up not only in Los Angeles but also in Pittsburgh.</p>
