        <p>LEAD: In a highly secret arrangement, the United States has long provided substantial covert assistance to the French nuclear weapons program, apparently in violation of American law, an authority on international relations says.</p>
        <p>In a highly secret arrangement, the United States has long provided substantial covert assistance to the French nuclear weapons program, apparently in violation of American law, an authority on international relations says.</p>
        <p>Under the arrangement, Washington furnished information to France on how to design and build nuclear weapons and to deliver them by missiles and aircraft. It has been highly beneficial to both countries and since the mid-1970's has encouraged the de facto reintegration of France into North Atlantic Treaty Organization's defense plans, Richard H. Ullman wrote in an article for the summer issue of Foreign Policy magazine. The French withdrew from the NATO defense arrangement in 1966.</p>
        <p>The agreement to share secret nuclear information with France was instituted more than 15 years ago by President Richard M. Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, who was also Secretary of State, and has been endorsed and approved by every President since, Mr. Ullman said. He added that it was followed with special vigor during the Carter Administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ullman, who is the David K. E. Bruce Professor of International Affairs at Princeton University, worked on the policy planning staff in the Defense Department and the National Security Council in the 1960's, and has also been an editorial writer for The New York Times.  Playing '20 Questions' To Inform the French</p>
        <p>A technique known as ''negative guidance,'' sometimes called ''20 questions,'' was used to circumvent American law forbidding the transfer of restricted nuclear data to France. In many years of what is described as perhaps the best-kept secret in recent Washington history, United States scientists were permitted to listen to French descriptions of that country's research programs and give guidance as to whether the French were on the right track, the article said.</p>
        <p>Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said today in Rome, where he is traveling with President Bush, that the secret arrangement between the United States and France was ''entirely consistent'' with the laws of both nations.</p>
        <p>When asked to comment on the Ullman article, a Pentagon spokeman, Lieut. Col. Keith Schneider, confirmed some aspects of it, saying the data exchange was consistent with existing agreements and not illegal.</p>
        <p>There have been several meetings involving American and French technicians every year since 1972 under the terms of a 1961 agreement on nuclear cooperation, Colonel Schneider said. In 1985, that 1961 agreement was ammended to encompass other forms of cooperation.</p>
        <p>''What we are talking about is a 1985 amendment to a 1961 agreement,'' he said. ''The 1961 agreement between the United States and France provides for exchange of classified information on military planning and protection against nuclear weapons affects and the operation of delivery systems.</p>
        <p>''France withdrew from NATO's integrated military structure in 1966. Following that, exchanges of unclassified nuclear information were resumed in 1972. They were aimed at improving our mutual understanding of technologies in order to enhance our mutual understanding of nuclear safety and measures to deal with nuclear weapons accidents.''</p>
        <p>The United States did not furnish actual designs or pieces of equipment, which would have been a clear violation of the law, but the exchanges of data between scientists had been so unrestrained, one official said, that officials sometimes worried about how much information had been given.</p>
        <p>The secrecy was much less important to the United States than it was to French politicians, who did not want to violate the Gaullist doctrine of French military independence from the United States and the public illusion that the French nuclear striking force was entirely home grown, Mr. Ullman said.  A Step-Saving Road To Nuclear Weapons</p>
        <p>The guidance probably saved France great expenditures and effort by steering it away from research paths that the more mature United States nuclear weapons program had already found flawed. Mr. Ullman said it also probably permitted the French to develop independently targetable multiple warheads - the basis of modern nuclear striking power - much sooner than would have been the case othewise.</p>
        <p>In turn, the article said, French Presidents and generals had agreed to coordinate target plans for their nuclear warheads much more closely with United States plans. But the French did not forego a city-killing target plan that it would use against the Soviet Union in case the United States refuses to use nuclear weapons to forestall an invasion of France.</p>
        <p>According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, the French now have 96 multiple warhead nuclear missiles on six submarines, and 18 ballistic missiles capable of reaching the Soviet Union in ground silos. They also have 18 long-range Mirage bombers and 38 navy planes that could carry nuclear weapons to some targets. The army has 32 shorter-range surface-to-surface missiles. The French nuclear forces, like those of Britain, were not covered by the 1987 American-Soviet medium-range missile treaty.  Keeping a Secret: 'A 1,000-Piece Puzzle'</p>
        <p>The French-American cooperation agreement has been of less significance in recent years as the French weapons research program has developed and become less dependent on outside assistance, Mr. Ullman said.</p>
        <p>Any taint of illegality may have been erased in 1985 when the United States and France negotiated a new executive agreement that permits sharing of restricted nuclear data. Pentagon officials told Mr. Ullman that the agreement was submitted to Congress, but Mr. Ullman said it was not clear that key figures on Capitol Hill had been aware of it or grasped its significance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ullman said his article was based on over 100 interviews in two years here and in France with former and present offcials, including many in ''the most sensitive positions.'' All declined to permit the use of their names.</p>
        <p>An assistant to Mr. Kissinger said he was unable to comment on the article. Some high former officials were unavailable or declined to comment, but several seemed at least slightly shocked at the revelation. ''I can't possibly comment,'' one said. Another said ''this involved several administrations.'' Still another said, ''I knew only a few pieces of a 1,000-piece puzzle.'' The remarks seemed to confirm Mr. Ullman's contention that the secret had been tightly held. The officials did not deny his account.</p>
        <p>A former Nixon Administration official, asked to comment on the article, said, ''People usually leak things to get them stopped. I don't think anyone thought this program should or would be stopped.''</p>
        <p>The decision in 1974 by President Nixon and Mr. Kissinger was a watershed in United States-French relations. Previously Congress and Presidents had believed that a ''third decision-making power'' on the use of nuclear weapons was dangerous.</p>
        <p>The Nixon team, Mr. Ullman said, decided that the arrangement was beneficial because it would increase uncertainty in the Soviet Union about a calamatious response to military agression. Moreover, he wrote, it appeared that nothing could dissuade the French from achieving independent nuclear status.</p>
        <p>France had already exploded a fission weapon in 1960 and a fusion weapon in 1968, years before the agreement went into effect. But refinements needed for an effective force apparently did grow out of it, the article said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ullman wrote, for instance, that ''The French sought and received advice on miniaturizing their warheads,'' which is necessary for independently targtetable mulitiple warheads, ''and on shielding them from electomagnetic radiation generated by nearby nuclear explosions.'' Information on missile design and how to conduct underground tests was also passed on, he said. The transfer of that kind of data was not prohibited by law.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the article said, ''the United States has made available intelligence data on Soviet targets and how they are defended,'' which could keep the French deterrent viable.  Extent of Cooperation Was Largely Unknown</p>
        <p>The fruits of the United States initiative have been many, Mr. Ullman suggested, leading to a diplomatic intimacy not much understood outside the highest American and French circles.</p>
        <p>He said that military cooperation between the once estranged partners was ''extraordinary'' in part because ''its full extent is unknown not only to the publics and to nearly all the elected politicians of the various countries involved but also to the most senior - let alone junior - civilian political-military bureaucrats in their foreign and defense ministries.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ullman wrote that officials of both countries saw the political significance of the arrangement as even greater than its military value. During the Carter Administration, for example, David Aaron, the deputy national security adviser, regularly traveled to Paris for consultations with French officials on a range of security issues.</p>
        <p>In early 1981, when the Reagan Administration took office in the United States and Francois Mitterrand took over the French presidency from Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Mr. Ullman wrote, the American Ambassador, Arthur Hartman, assured Mr. Mitterrand that Washington wanted the nuclear relationship to continue. To the French leader, according to the article, this was an important indication that the United States would treat his Socialist Government as it had its conservative predecessors.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Aaron nor Mr. Hartman was available for comment.</p>
        <p>French Role in NATO: A New Monkey Wrench?</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Ullman, secret but intense joint military planning has induced France to immediately make available its sea and airports, railroads and pipelines in case of war and to move its forces into central Germany where, according to an American officer, ''they are going to be in the chain of command'' of the Atlantic alliance for practical purposes, despite professed French independence.</p>
        <p>This is significant because, despite American complaints about Soviet bloc military superiority, the Western alliance with France included has more men under arms than the Warsaw Pact, he said. A good deal of this was already known, but Mr. Ullman provides new detail.</p>
        <p>In the early 1980's, Mr. Ullman wrote, ''Operational coordination of French tactical air forces and NATO air forces in Central Europe became considerably tighter. Selected French airfields were earmarked and surveyed to serve as potential dispersion bases for NATO's airborne early warning system.''</p>
        <p>Despite the advantages that he believes grew out of the agreement, Mr. Ullman wrote that ''it is a narrow question whether American policymakers were justified'' in their decision. ''It seems clear that the U.S.-French nuclear program contravened the spirit of the Atomic Energy Act,'' he said, and suggested elsewhere that the letter of the law had also been violated.</p>
        <p>Possible drawbacks are that the agreement could complicate Soviet-American arms talks and that West Germany may feel that the United States was never sincere about its professed policies on nuclear proliferation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ullman suggested that it was time to make the covert cooperation overt, saying even French politicians sensitive to nationalist sentiments and Gaullist theory had little to lose now by doing so. ---- French Have No Comment PARIS, May 27 - French officials had no comment on Mr. Ullman's article until they had a chance to read it, but they stressed that France remained committed to its position as a member of NATO autonomous of the alliance's integrated command.</p>
        <p>In recent years, there have been numerous signs of what some diplomats call ''France's de facto integration'' in NATO.</p>
        <p>American commanders have privately said they have no doubt that France would participate from the first hour in the case of a Warsaw Pact assault on Western Europe. President Mitterrand and other French leaders have made it clear that they would regard any attack on West Germany to be an attack on France.</p>
        <p>Francois Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said Mr. Ullman's revelations might not have a big impact in France because ''the French have become a lot more relaxed about these things than they used to be.''</p>
        <p>''If you have an independent nuclear force you can decide to use it in various ways,'' said Mr. Heisbourg, who is French. ''If you're truly independent, you can have a dialogue and you can have contingency planning that covers the whole spectrum of possbilities.''</p>
