        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We recently went from Vienna to Prague by train. Our travel agent had arranged to have us picked up at the railroad station. Alas, nobody came. After waiting for an hour I heard a gentleman giving instructions in English. When I asked him where and how to get a taxi, he told us that many of them overcharge and volunteered to take us to our hotel by Metro.</p>

        <p>We recently went from Vienna to Prague by train. Our travel agent had arranged to have us picked up at the railroad station. Alas, nobody came. After waiting for an hour I heard a gentleman giving instructions in English. When I asked him where and how to get a taxi, he told us that many of them overcharge and volunteered to take us to our hotel by Metro.</p>
        <p>Not only did he go out of his way, but he also carried our two heavy suitcases all the way to the lobby of the hotel. It turned out that he was a Czech scientist who just wanted to do a good deed.</p>
        <p>Such kindness deserves public recognition, especially in times when one mostly hears of holdups and misdeeds against tourists. JOSEPH BAUER  Flushing, Queens</p>
