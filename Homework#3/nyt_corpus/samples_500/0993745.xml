        <p>PRINTS line the walls of Herschel and Fern Cohen's  stately colonial home. From  floor to ceiling, stacked four or five high, up the stairs, down the hallway, in the office, bedrooms and bathrooms, hundreds of lithographs, wood engravings, woodcuts and etchings evoke images of the Depression era. Huddled masses, powerful workers, robust-looking ''fat cat'' capitalists, sharecroppers and coal miners, represented almost entirely in black and white, dominant the collection of realistic works.</p>
        <p>This pre-eminent collection of  American prints depicting the Great Depression is the passion of a Wall Street portfolio manager who focuses on the psychology of investors and their swings from optimism to pessimism.</p>
        <p>The images of breadlines and sweatshop workers after the stock market crash of 1929 moved Mr. Cohen, 57, who has worked at Smith Barney Asset Management for 30 years, and his wife, an elementary school librarian in Roslyn, to canvas museums, galleries and auctions.</p>
        <p>Part of the Cohens' vast collection,  104 prints from 89 print makers, is on display through April 19 at the Heckscher Museum in Huntington in ''Visions of a Changing America: Depression Era Prints From the Collection of Herschel and Fern Cohen.''</p>
        <p>''I think there were three periods in this country's history that were unlike any other periods -- the Civil War, the Depression and World War II -- that just changed people's lives forever,'' said Mr. Cohen, who has a Ph.D. in physiological psychology and originally planned to be a college professor. ''Art from the Depression is a window. It's a window into my parents' behavior. It's a window into how people think. I'm so fascinated by how people react to, exist in, come out of periods of unbelievable change and duress.''</p>
        <p>The ''rush'' Mr. Cohen feels from finding Depression images, and his obsession with collecting them, stems from his childhood.</p>
        <p>''Something about these Depression images, they excited me,'' he said. ''I love images with people. My parents were so Depression driven. They were wonderful people who would never take a risk.''</p>
        <p>His father started out in the 1930's selling used records.His mother quit high school to go to work to help support her family. Her father, a manual laborer, shoveled coal and gravel.</p>
        <p>''All of our family lived in two-family houses plus attics,'' said Mr. Cohen, a Long Island resident who grew up in Cleveland. ''My grandparents lived upstairs, my aunts and uncles lived next door, my cousins lived in the attic.Everybody pitched in and worked.</p>
        <p>''There was one painting in the house and that was by a guy my dad had grown up with. There was no art in the house and no luxuries, period.''</p>
        <p>Like many collections, the Cohens'  began accidentally. He knew nothing  about art, she knew very little. While shopping for a rolltop desk, Mr. Cohen stumbled across American paintings in a gallery and bought one instead of a desk.</p>
        <p>''It was 1976, the year of the Bicentennial,'' he said. ''There were a lot of celebrations in the museums about American art. My interest was starting to peak and we really flipped for it. The great thing about this country is, even if your parents were immigrants, you kind of take the history of this country as your own. We fell in love with this American art of the 19th century. We made it a mission to go around looking at all this stuff and learning about it. We went to Washington, we started going to regional museums. We went to Vermont, Pennsylvania, all over. We just fell in love with American art.''</p>
        <p>As much as the Cohens loved  paintings, especially urban landscapes, they could not afford them.</p>
        <p>Visiting the National Collection of Fine Arts (now the National Museum of American Art) and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the Cohens were drawn to social realist and industrial prints. Twentieth-century renderings by artists like Howard Cook and Louis Lozowick were a natural extension of the Hudson River landscapes they loved. Mr. Cohen began to form a ''wish list.''</p>
        <p>Immersing himself in his pursuit, he researched art at the public library and talked to local gallery owners about prints. He bought his  first prints at an auction.</p>
        <p>''The prints were really very, very inexpensive, which was perfect,'' he said. ''For someone who came from a background of never spending money on any kind of luxury, I loved this stuff and I didn't feel like I was breaking the bank to do it. Nobody cared. They weren't popular. Especially the kind of stuff I liked.</p>
        <p>''I liked the landscapes, but in their stacks I would see an occasional  industrial scene or something with people in it and I loved it. Maybe they  didn't know too much about it. I responded to them and I would buy them.</p>
        <p>He added: ''I could really decorate a house with them.I had no downside risk. I was always thinking: 'Is this really bad to do? Spend money on this?' I felt that since they were so relatively inexpensive and they were original art, what could my downside risk be?</p>
        <p>''I never ever thought of this as investment. Talk about Depression era mentality. I always thought if I lose my job and things get bad and I needed to sell things, could I get something near my money back? It was a luxury. I always worried about security. That came from my parents, and that's a Depression thing.''</p>
        <p>Fifteen million people, or almost 25 percent of the work force, were  unemployed during the Depression. Among them were 10,000 artists. Under President Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration, 5,000 artists secured jobs. Among the painters, sculptors and muralists were 300  print makers.</p>
        <p>The works they produced, made in editions of 25, of which the artist could keep 3, examined the economic crisis around them. Prints of strike scenes and bread lines, tomato pickers and subway riders were distributed to schools, hospitals, libraries and museums.</p>
        <p>''The Depression era art would be nonexistent had the Government not sponsored the W.P.A. program,'' said Mary Ryan, owner of a Manhattan gallery specializing in American prints from the 1920's to the present. ''During the height of the Depression, there weren't people buying art,'' she said. ''Some of the greatest artists who worked in the 20th century in America were kept employed by the W.P.A..''</p>
        <p>Among Mr. Cohen's favorite images at the Hecksher show is Clare Leighton's ''Bread Line, New York,''  a 1932 wood engraving showing long lines of people hoping for assistance, huddled under the elevated train tracks, a loan shop sign nearby, with the metropolis in the background.</p>
        <p>In Albert Potter's 1932 linocut, ''Brother Can You Spare a Dime,'' a  man stands, hand outstretched, in front of a throng, while a skeleton hovers above the cityscape. The title was borrowed from the Rudy Vallee and Bing Crosby song, often thought of as the anthem of the Depression.</p>
        <p>Mabel Dwight's 1935 lithograph, ''Merchants of Death,'' a social commentary reflecting failed capitalism, portrays a skeleton leading a group of businessmen that evolve into vultures.</p>
        <p>''Spiderboy,'' a 1936 etching by James Allen, shows a muscular construction worker perched on a steel beam high above the city. This glorified image of a worker reminds Mr. Cohen of his grandfather.</p>
        <p>Anne Cohen DePietro, curator of  the Hecksher Museum, said that the Depression era collection showed ''America in transition from a rural economy to an industrial economy, from an agrarian-based society to the Industrial Revolution on into the big metropolises that were burgeoning in the 30's.''</p>
        <p>''It documents a period of very exciting transition in America and of great hardship as well as testimony to the resilience of the human spirit,'' she said. Continuing, she said: ''Because they didn't have to worry about finding patrons to purchase  their work, the artists were freed up to explore subjects that they would never have dreamed of having had the freedom to create if they were looking for patrons to buy. It opened the doors creatively.''</p>
        <p>Bent and stooped coal miners, covered in soot, trudge home after work, in Michael Gallagher's 1938 etching, ''Scranton Coal Miners.'' Maxine Seelbinder, an obscure print maker, created depressing scenes of tenement life in the 1933 lithograph, ''Housing Needed.''</p>
        <p>''By collecting in that period you can find these treasures that nobody cared about, nobody wanted,'' said Mr. Cohen, admiring one of Seelbinder's images on the wall of his home office. ''There is no information available at any public library  or print book about her. How pessimistic must you be if you only print six of them. She was obviously drawing what she really felt. God, I love this.''</p>
        <p>The 30's were also the ''age of urban optimism,'' the era of the skyscraper, elevated trains and industrial architecture. Artists glorified the  machine age and burgeoning steel industry.</p>
        <p>''After the W.P.A. program was over, the work that was left was largely destroyed,'' Ms. Ryan said.  ''It was burned and discarded . A lot  of work was used for pipe insulation and as scrap paper for Rikers Island inmates.'' Only a few prints remained.</p>
        <p>Initially, Depression era art was viewed as a social realistic embarassment, and a reminder of a difficult time, said Ms. Ryan. It wasn't until the 1970's that people began to look at Depression era art anew. Although out of the mainstream of 80's art collecting, burgeoning interest in the last 20 years has dramatically increased their value.</p>
        <p>In 1981, it was Ms. Ryan, whose gallery specialized in 1930's W.P.A. material, who validated Mr. Cohen's interest in the subset of collecting.</p>
        <p>''It was love at first sight,'' Mr.  Cohen said. ''All of a sudden, I found somebody who formally liked the stuff that I had sort of been thinking about but had no information about. I hadn't seen any literature about stuff I liked. She would track down the artists and things I never thought about doing. I finally found someone to share the excitement with, somebody who knew what they were doing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ryan helped him define why he liked the Depression era art and sought out the same material. He started meeting the few other dealers and collectors around the country who share his passion.</p>
        <p>The Cohens, who also accumulate doorstops, weathervanes and Americana, hope to keep their collection intact and growing.</p>
        <p>''If I'm a collector, it doesn't make me happy that things went up, because there's always something else out there,'' Mr. Cohen said.</p>
