        <p>Derek Walcott, the West Indian poet whose luminous writings evoke the cultural diversity and richness of the Caribbean, won the Nobel Prize in Literature yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Swedish Academy of Letters said in its formal announcement in Stockholm that Mr. Walcott, who is 62 years old, was being honored for his "melodious and sensitive" style.</p>
        <p>The academy's citation noted Mr. Walcott's "historical vision, the outcome of a multi-cultural commitment." Spokesman for a Culture</p>
        <p>"In his literary works Walcott has laid a course for his own cultural environment, but through them he speaks to each and every one of us," the academy's citation reads. "In him, West Indian culture has found its great poet."</p>
        <p>This year's Nobel Prize carries a cash award of $1.2 million. The formal presentation for Nobel laureates from all fields will be on Dec. 10 in Stockholm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walcott teaches literature and creative writing at Boston University and lives in Brookline, Mass., but he was born on St. Lucia. He said yesterday that "all the races of the world" are represented in the Caribbean, giving a "tremendous possibility of an example of unity."</p>
        <p>"That sounds pompous, but I mean it," he told The Associated Press, saying he was "still a little stunned" about winning the award.</p>
        <p>Although acclaimed as a poet, Mr. Walcott is also a playwright, journalist and painter. He divides his time between the United States and Trinidad, and it is the Caribbean that serves as the source of his poetry's cadences and idioms. He has often been praised for his ability to fuse the classics, folklore and history and to combine the vernacular and the grand manner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walcott's latest poetic work, "Omeros" (1990), which runs 325 pages, "weaves his many strands into a whole," the academy said. Mr. Walcott has said that "Omeros," whose principal characters have names taken from the "Iliad" and "Odyssey" of Homer, was meant to capture "the whole experience of the people of the Caribbean."</p>
        <p>The academy, an 18-member assembly of Swedish authors and academics, selects Nobel winners by consensus. The selection of Mr. Walcott fits the academy's pattern of trying to encompass varying styles, languages and cultures with the award. Last year, the winner was Nadine Gordimer, the South African writer. The most recent poet to win was Octavio Paz, a Mexican, in 1990.</p>
        <p>Although the academy refuses to give the names of other contenders, Swedish publishers and cultural editors said heavy favorites in speculation preceding the prize announcement included the Trinidad-born novelist V. S. Naipaul, the Irish poet Seamus Heaney and Hugo Claus, a Belgian poet, playwright and novelist who writes in Flemish.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walcott has long been mentioned by Swedish publishers and cultural editors as a front-runner for the award, and the academy's decision was greeted with enthusiasm yesterday throughout the literary community.</p>
        <p>Harold Bloom, the author and literary critic who teaches at Yale University, said Mr. Walcott "certainly merits the prize on the basis of his poetic accomplishment and as a representative figure in terms of the English-language poetry that has come out of the West Indies."</p>
        <p>The novelist Jamaica Kincaid, who was born in Antigua, said of Mr. Walcott's writing, "It says to me that I'm very alive."</p>
        <p>"Our historical experience becomes this important thing that I never knew before," she said in a telephone interview from her home in Vermont. "I thought we were just part of the riffraff of the British Empire until I read this man and thought: 'Oh, yes, that is me. That is us.' It is a great day to be a British West Indian." Work Growing Out of Life</p>
        <p>Mr. Walcott was born in 1930 in the town of Castries in St. Lucia, a former British colony in the Lesser Antilles.  The Swedish Academy noted that his experience growing up on an isolated volcanic island had apparently greatly influenced his life and work. His poetry includes "In a Green Night," the 1962 collection that is viewed as his breakthrough, and "Another Life," his autobiographical poem of 1973. Among his more significant plays -- which tend to be more loosely structured than his carefully honed poetry -- are several bittersweet tales of life in the Caribbean, including "Dream on Monkey Mountain," "The Joker of Seville" and "O Babylon!"</p>
        <p>Mr. Walcott's work also reflects a struggle to confront the colonial past of his native Caribbean and his mixed-race background, which combines an African, Dutch and English ancestry. His grandmothers were said to have been descendants of slaves and he has white grandfathers on both sides of the family. In "Another Life," he speaks of himself as "the divided child of the wrong color."</p>
        <p>"Three loyalties are central for him," the academy said, "the Caribbean where he lives, the English language and his African origin."</p>
        <p>In the poem "A Far Cry From Africa," he wrote, "How choose/Between this Africa and the English tongue I love?" His poetry also addresses the bitter legacy of slavery.  In his 1979 work about Jamaica, "The Star-Apple Kingdom," he wrote of the "groom, the cattleboy, the housemaid" and "the good Negroes down in the village, their mouths in the locked jaw of a silent scream."</p>
        <p>In interviews, Mr. Walcott has recalled his island childhood and its influence on his work. He told The New Yorker in 1971 that islands "are a great place to live because the sea is close and there is the elemental feeling of things that are bigger than you are." The son of two schoolteachers, he also told the magazine that he, his twin brother and elder sister "grew up with a terrific mother in a house full of books." Mr. Walcott's father, who was also a painter, died when Mr. Walcott was 1 year old. His brother, Roderick, is a poet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walcott has said that he came early to an appreciation of poetry. In an interview with The New York Times in 1982, he said that he became infatuated with the style of great English poetry as a schoolboy, which "cultivated colonials" presented to him as "living speech." His first collection of poetry was privately printed, under the name D. A. Walcott, when he was still a teen-ager. He designed the book to resemble the distinctive Faber collections of Eliot, Auden and other major contemporary poets published in England.</p>
        <p>Having failed to win a scholarship to England because of his poor math scores, Mr. Walcott won a scholarship to the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, where he majored in French, Latin and Spanish. On a Rockefeller Foundation grant in New York in 1957 and 1958, he attended Jose Quintero's directing classes and the rehearsals of th Phoenix Theater's repertory company. By the time he was 30, he had published two volumes of poetry, established the Trinidad Theater Workshop and had his plays being performed throughout the Caribbean and in London.</p>
        <p>In 1981, Mr. Walcott received a $250,000 award from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in Chicago, one of the series of awards intended to support "exceptionally talented individuals."</p>
        <p>That same year a student at Harvard, where Mr. Walcott was teaching a poetry workshop, accused him of sexually harassing her. He denied the charge, but after an investigation the university concluded that it had merit and wrote a letter of reproach to Boston University.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walcott has spoken of the immense respect that West Indians have for the Caribbean Sea and how his own vision of the world is shaped by waves. In an interview in The New York Times in 1990, he said that that summer was the first time "I had been around mountains."</p>
        <p>"I was in Colorado," he said. "At first I didn't know what bothered me about them. But then I noticed it: whole ranges of mountains, stacks of them, and they never move." Mixing the Classical and Folkways</p>
        <p>Derek Walcott has expressed his love for the classics, folklore and history in his poetry (published by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux) and in numerous works for the stage. Here is a list of his published works.  Poetry</p>
