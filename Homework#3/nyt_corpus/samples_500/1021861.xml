        <p>Re your May 31 front-page article on migrant farm workers: The inhuman living conditions of many migrant farm workers result from the distorted supply of labor to United States farms. Many Americans cannot afford to accept the low wages offered by agricultural employers because they would have to forfeit their social welfare benefits. This creates a surplus of impoverished farm laborers, many of whom are illegal immigrants.</p>

        <p>Re your May 31 front-page article on migrant farm workers: The inhuman living conditions of many migrant farm workers result from the distorted supply of labor to United States farms. Many Americans cannot afford to accept the low wages offered by agricultural employers because they would have to forfeit their social welfare benefits. This creates a surplus of impoverished farm laborers, many of whom are illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>To attract more citizens to low-paying jobs like farm labor, income above the poverty level has to be assured. The Government should cash out its narrowly defined corporate and social welfare programs and redirect that money to every American in an annual tax rebate that, when added to the minimum wage, would bring every worker above the poverty level.</p>
