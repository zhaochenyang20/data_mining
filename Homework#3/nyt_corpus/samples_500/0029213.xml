        <p>LEAD: My litany of household luxuries is simpler than most - I don't really want to live with taffeta curtains that puddle on the floor, with walls tinted by layers of hand-rubbed lacquer or even with a roomful of 18th-century museum-quality antiques. Luxuries like these are too costly and too obvious for my tastes.</p>
        <p>My litany of household luxuries is simpler than most - I don't really want to live with taffeta curtains that puddle on the floor, with walls tinted by layers of hand-rubbed lacquer or even with a roomful of 18th-century museum-quality antiques. Luxuries like these are too costly and too obvious for my tastes. I prefer smaller and more subtle symbols: never running out of ice, not having to fumble for a bedside light switch, a television remote control that lets me effortlessly silence unbearable commercials. I am, however, fond of comfort, and although I don't like to admit it, some simple luxuries that I cherish - and that few others even notice -have probably cost me as much as a bird's-eye maple highboy.</p>
        <p>Take the case of the ice-maker in my country barn, which has become a center of activity on August afternoons. Guests never comment on its form or beauty as they fill their glasses, but I am unable to pick up a cube without remembering that installing this modern device in my century-old kitchen cost $1,200 more than the estimate. Getting it hitched up forced a review of the inefficient wiring, resulting in the entire place being rewired. Even the plumbing costs skyrocketed. On quiet nights, when I hear the mysterious clunking of water being turned into icy slices, I recall the bill for the expensive copper tubing that was snaked through the joists of the ripped-up floor by an equally expensive plumber.</p>
        <p>That experience taught me that simple comforts do not come simply. It's also a classic example of the Mushroom Effect: However small a renovation project seems at the beginning, it will inevitably grow larger, costing more money or taking more time than anticipated. And sometimes both. In the case of the ice-maker, I was lucky - those joists might have been rotten and the floor could have collapsed.</p>
        <p>Another premise often applies to renovation projects: If you make mistakes, learn to live with them gracefully. I doubt if I'll ever be happy about the world-class mildew growing in the cupboard over the downstairs shower, but it's my fault for being greedy. Storage space, I've always felt, is the ultimate luxury, and that vacant spot above the shower had irritated me for years. Remodeling the bathroom gave me the perfect opportunity to make the space useful, although this, too, shot my budget over the moon. ''Custom cabinetry and extra tiling weren't included in the original estimate,'' the contractor frostily reminded me. But the real tragedy was that I never gave a thought to the consequences of constant dampness: Nothing can be stored in that cupboard except mildew. Guests - who so jauntily ignore the ice-maker's expensive charms - are universally fascinated. They bring nostrums and make creative suggestions for adaptive re-use. The best idea so far has been the notion of taking off the doors and making the cupboard into an overhead fernery, but I sense that the only graceful way to cope with mildew is to live and let live.</p>
        <p>I should point out, however, that some of my ideas of quiet luxuries have indeed been successes - and inexpensive ones at that. After all, my remote control came free with my new television set. And on one rainy afternoon I made a trip to the dime store and installed hand switches on the cords of every lamp in the house. The lamp fix was so satisfying that I went for the linen closet, a jumble of mismatched sheets. Pulling out every sheet, I tried them on the four sizes of beds that inhabit my bedrooms and marked them clearly with the bed size they fitted. Luxurious order at last.</p>
        <p>Still, I am often alone in the appreciation of these small comforts and conveniences. Others take them for granted and comment instead on flashier items - like the needlework cushions heaped on my sofa. Old embroidered cushions are a design icon these days, though mine wouldn't survive the scrutiny of any decorator of the English-country-house persuasion. Mostly flea-market bits and pieces, they are definitely of the lower order. Still, they are treasured finds and whether Berlin work, beaded or cross-stitched, those cushions represent a luxury to me: I had every shabby one of them restuffed with down. These days, designers wax lyrical about down. The difference between feathers and polyester may be invisible, they preach, but the derriere and the back know for sure. My guests sink comfortably into that heap of cushions, never aware that each is a triumph of natural over man-made fibers. ''What a fabulous collection of fancy pillows you have,'' they exclaim, stretching back. Secretly, I know, they are praising the wrong luxury - the down stuffing is what really counts.</p>
        <p>Sometimes - usually while lying in a bubble bath where such thoughts seem to come more clearly - I muse on other quiet comforts I would like to add to my life. Some are affordable, requiring only time and organization. I would like, for example, to replace all the wire clothes hangers in my closets with sturdy padded versions.</p>
        <p>Other luxuries are a bit more involved but are still possible, such as having every door in the house rehung so the latches fit tightly (starting with the particularly mischievous upstairs bathroom door, which silently swings open on its own with no warning). And while I'm at it, I'd like to replace the hollow-core bedroom doors with solid ones - I'm tired of wiggly clothes hooks.</p>
        <p>But other luxuries are well beyond my reach, like new living-room curtains. The used-but-still-elegant pair I bought at a house sale 12 years ago for $30 are now in shreds. Replacement fabric, I discovered after much research, is woven to order at 18 inches wide, has a six-month delivery date and costs $100 a yard.</p>
        <p>I plan to study up on how Miss Haversham handled such tattered situations and work for more affordable comforts. This summer, in fact, I'm going to collar a couple of guests to help me figure out the circuit-breaker box. For more than a decade I have never known which switch controls which room or appliance; the scrawled labels are now hopelessly unreadable. Two hours ought to do it, I figure, and I'll be rid of flickering confusion forever. I'll have to bribe them with ice-laden drinks, but that simple fix will probably be the most satisfying household luxury of all.</p>
