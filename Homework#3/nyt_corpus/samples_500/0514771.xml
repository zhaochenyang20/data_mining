        <p>Fokker N.V., the Dutch aerospace group, said the parent company of a rival, Alenia S.p.A. of Italy, had taken a 6 percent stake in the company. Fokker added that it was awaiting news on the Italian company's motives.</p>
        <p>Alenia's parent, Finmeccanica S.p.A., made its stake known under a new Dutch share-disclosure law that went into effect in February, a Fokker spokesman said. In Rome, Finmeccanica said it would not comment on its motives for taking the Fokker stake. The holding would have cost about 70 million guilders, or $37 million, at Fokker's current stock price.</p>
