        <p>The software maker SAP warned yesterday that its revenue declined 3 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the period a year earlier, but that it was slightly better than analysts had expected. On a preliminary basis, revenue fell to 930 million euros ($1.2 billion) as a result of weak corporate demand and currency effects, the company said. SAP, which is based in Germany, said it had expected its operating margin to exceed the previously forecast 25 percent for 2003.</p>
