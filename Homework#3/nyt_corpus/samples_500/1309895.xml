        <p>A July 11 front-page article about the massacre of the Jews of Jedwabne by their Polish neighbors on July 10, 1941, focuses on the attitude of many Poles who still seek to deny their complicity in this horrific act.</p>
        <p>Why is it that the perpetrators of this crime have gone unpunished? Why has it taken more than 50 years for Polish authorities to begin an investigation into what took place?</p>

        <p>Full acceptance into the Western family of nations should be denied to any Baltic or former Eastern European-bloc country that does not demonstrate a complete repudiation of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by its countrymen in World War II. This would require bringing criminal charges against all those involved in, for example, the massacres at Jebwabne, at Babi Yar in Ukraine, Kovno in Lithuania and Riga in Latvia.</p>
