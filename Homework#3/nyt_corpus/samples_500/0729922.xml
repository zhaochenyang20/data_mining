        <p>New guidelines for the best treatment of manic-depressive illness were issued today, emphasizing that the illness can be successfully treated with the right combination of drugs and psychotherapy, but that it is often misdiagnosed and mistreated.</p>
        <p>Susan Dime-Meehan, executive director of the National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association, based in Chicago, said at a news conference held today by the American Psychiatric Association that the new guidelines "will lead to earlier diagnosis and better treatment."</p>
        <p>The guidelines, she added, "are the minimum that patients should now expect from their doctors."</p>
        <p>The American Psychiatric Association today officially issued the 30-page manual on the best methods of treating people with manic-depression, which doctors now often call bipolar affective disorder. It is characterized by wide mood swings, often alternating between manic elation and severe depression.</p>
        <p>Two million to three million adults in the United States, or about 1.6 percent of the nation's population, suffer from the disorder. Without treatment, about one-fifth of those with the illness will commit suicide.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert Hirschfeld, chairman of the group that compiled the report for the psychiatric association, said that the disorder was often mistaken for alcoholism, wildness or other forms of acting out. Even when it is diagnosed, the best forms of treatment are often not used.</p>
        <p>"The biggest change in recent years in the treatment of this disorder is that there are new drugs which appear to be very helpful, and there are also now psychotherapies designed specifically to treat bipolar disorder."</p>
        <p>Lithium, a drug whose use for manic-depression was discovered four decades ago, remains the best basic treatment for most people, the guidelines say. But they also said that for about one-third or more patients, the drugs valproate and carbamazepine are useful as mood-stabilizers.</p>
        <p>Another type of drug, the benzodiazepine class of tranquilizers, are also used to help calm patients while lithium and the other two drugs take effect over several weeks.</p>
        <p>The guidelines now suggest that the various drugs used to stabilize a patient's mood should be tried before another group of drugs that has been commonly used. They are the anti-psychotic drugs like Haldol, and others in the class of neuroleptics.</p>
        <p>The manic-depressive illness is one in which patients cycle between depression and mania, with the mania being the symptom that sets it apart from regular "unipolar" depression.</p>
        <p>The manic phase is marked by a sharp change in personality, often including a sudden lack of a need for sleep. It is also marked by extravagant behavior.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dime-Meehan, a former corporate executive who herself suffers from mania, noted that she once spent $27,000 in one week on clothes, and flew from Chicago to Los Angeles for lunch 32 times in less than a year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dime-Meehan said that in a survey her group had done, people with the disorder took an average of eight years of seeking help, from at least three doctors, before getting the right diagnosis. "These guidelines now tell you what to expect from your doctor," she added.</p>
        <p>The new guidelines, called "Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Patients with Bipolar Disorder," are published as a supplement to the American Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 151, No. 12, December 1994, and are available from the American Psychiatric Association, 1400 K St., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20007</p>
