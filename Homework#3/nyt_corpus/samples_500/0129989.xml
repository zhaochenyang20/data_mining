        <p>The Southland Corporation said today that it was raising $320 million for its recent leveraged buyout through a loan from its convenience-store licensee in Japan.</p>
        <p>Citicorp International arranged the financing in conjunction with the Diamond Lease Company and the Tokyo Leasing Company, which acted as lead managers for a syndicate of Japanese financial institutions, Southland said.</p>
        <p>Principal and interest on the loan from the 7-Eleven Japan Company Ltd. will be repaid from future royalties the company owes Southland for use of the 7-Eleven name, Southland said.</p>
        <p>Of the loan proceeds, $300 million will be applied toward repayment of debt incurred in the recently completed $4.9 billion leveraged buyout that took the company private, officials said.</p>
