        <p>On the day Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat shook hands in Washington to seal their peace pact, Atef Adwan sat bound and blindfolded in an Israeli Army detention center here as celebrations erupted in the streets.</p>
        <p>"I heard singing outside the jail, cheers from pro-Arafat prisoners and cries from the interrogation section," he recalled.</p>
        <p>The date was Sept. 13. A reputed leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement, a Palestinian group better known as Hamas, Mr. Adwan had been held for a few days for questioning after returning from exile in southern Lebanon on Sept. 9.</p>
        <p>He had come back with about half of nearly 400 accused Islamic militants who had been expelled from the territories by Israel in December after a series of deadly attacks by Palestinians. Israel has agreed to allow the rest of the deportees to return by the end of this year. Palestinian Flags Everywhere</p>
        <p>When he finally got home, Mr. Adwan, who teaches political science and history at Islamic University in Gaza, found a changed city. Palestinian flags flew everywhere, buildings were plastered with pictures of Mr. Arafat and thousands of his supporters were holding rallies and marches. Followers of Mr. Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization dominated the streets.</p>
        <p>Hamas, which vehemently opposes peace with Israel, was thrown on the defensive.</p>
        <p>The agreement on Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho is a serious challenge to Hamas, whose popularity had grown here as despair had deepened during nearly two years of fruitless Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Though Hamas militants have kept up a steady barrage of sometimes fatal attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians in an effort to scuttle the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, the movement is in a political quandary. P.L.O. Legitimized</p>
        <p>With preparations under way for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and with P.L.O. followers promoting what they say is their first achievement on the ground in the occupied territories, Hamas has been forced to adjust to a new political landscape in which Israel has legitimized the P.L.O. and expects to cooperate with the group against Islamic militants.</p>
        <p>Israel has tolerated the opening of offices in the territories by Fatah, the mainstream faction of the P.L.O., where men and women have been enlisting in a planned Palestinian police force. Notices signed by Fatah and its youth movement, Shabiba, appear in the Palestinian press, uncensored by Israel.</p>
        <p>Hamas leaders say they worry that the P.L.O will use its authority under a future self-governing arrangement to repress its Islamic opponents, as the secular governments of Egypt and Algeria do.</p>
        <p>They warn that the Palestinian police, trained in Egypt and Jordan, might duplicate methods used in those countries against Islamic fundamentalists. And they predict possible clashes if the police try to block attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israeli troops and settlers.</p>
        <p>"The question is whether the police will serve the people or will be used against the people, as in Egypt or Algeria," said Salem Salamah, another returning deportee, who is dean of academic affairs at the Islamic University.</p>
        <p>"I'm concerned that our graduates may be refused government jobs and our people will be denied licenses and permits because we are from the opposition," he added. Conciliatory Voices</p>
        <p>Although Hamas leaflets vow an unrelenting struggle against the plan for self-rule and urge Palestinians to step up attacks on Israeli soldiers and settlers, some voices are more conciliatory, apparently reflecting a desire not to be excluded from the new political order emerging in the territories.</p>
        <p>Sheik Hamed al-Bitawi, a leading Islamic cleric who also recently returned from exile in Lebanon, was recently quoted in a Palestinian newspaper as saying that "we do not oppose the P.L.O.'s efforts to recover part of our country," though he insisted that "no part of Palestine" could be given up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adwan said Hamas might take part in the elections planned in the territories for next year, provided that the voting was for "a Government and Parliament with authority to set policy." Mr. Salamah said Hamas could join a self-governing council if it were assured of proportional representation of 45 percent, a figure that he said would reflect Hamas's strength among the people.</p>
        <p>But even if Hamas did boycott the elections, Mr. Adwan added, the movement could still be active as a political party, offering Palestinians an alternative to the arrangement for self-government and aligning itself with secular opposition groups.  Other Elections</p>
        <p>Hamas leaders say that if they shun the vote for a self-governing council, they could still run in municipal elections and compete for the leadership of professional associations, unions, chambers of commerce and student councils on which Islamic representatives have made gains in recent years. Even in defeat they have often drawn between 35 to 45 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>On the grass-roots level, Hamas leaders hope to maintain their movement's influence, which has been built through a growing network of social service organizations aided by financing from Saudi Arabia, other gulf Arab states and Iran. Hamas has used Islamic welfare groups to win support, especially in the impoverished Gaza Strip, where it has filled gaps left by inadequate Government services.</p>
        <p>Islamic associations run kindergartens and summer camps. They give food and money to poor families, provide clothing and financial aid to orphans and needy pupils and have organized cleanup and home repair campaigns in refugee neighborhoods. One group in Gaza appealed this week for donations to families whose houses were recently rocketed by Israeli troops searching for armed fugitives.</p>
        <p>"Our actions speak louder than 100 mosque sermons," said Ibrahim al-Yazuri, a pharmacist who leads Al-Mujama al-Islami, an Islamic group founded in Gaza in the 1970's. Hamas, a militant offshoot of Al-Mujama al-Islami, emerged when the Palestinian uprising began in the occupied territories in December 1987.</p>
