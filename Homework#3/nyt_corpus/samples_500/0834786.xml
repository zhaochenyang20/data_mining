        <p>What does it feel like to win a week for once? People at CBS found out yesterday, when Nielsen numbers showed that the network had finished first in the prime-time ratings race last week -- for the first time this season.</p>
        <p>"It's very good for morale," said Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Entertainment.</p>
        <p>CBS had an 11.4 average Nielsen rating for the week. (Each rating point equals 959,000 homes.) NBC had 10.6, ABC 9.4 and Fox a 7.7.</p>

        <p>What does it feel like to win a week for once? People at CBS found out yesterday, when Nielsen numbers showed that the network had finished first in the prime-time ratings race last week -- for the first time this season.</p>
        <p>"It's very good for morale," said Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Entertainment.</p>
        <p>CBS had an 11.4 average Nielsen rating for the week. (Each rating point equals 959,000 homes.) NBC had 10.6, ABC 9.4 and Fox a 7.7.</p>
        <p>For February -- a "sweeps" month -- CBS nosed out ABC for second-place behind the mighty NBC. NBC won the month with a 12.2 average. CBS's average was 10.5, ABC's was 10.2, and Fox's was 8.0.</p>
        <p>CBS did well with the Grammy Awards last Wednesday (14.6 rating), and a Friday special, "Sergei Grinkov: Celebration of a Life" (10.3), featuring the young figure skater Yekaterina Gordeyeva and other skating stars in a tribute to her husband and pairs partner, Mr. Grinkov, who died of a heart attack in November.</p>
        <p>But David F. Poltrack, CBS's vice president of research, said the average rating for CBS's regularly scheduled shows was higher (10.8) than its overall rating (10.5) in February's sweeps.</p>
        <p>"We've got a solid Saturday, Sunday and Monday now," Mr. Poltrack said. Which makes it easier to forget about the show that was supposed to herald a new, younger, more glitzy CBS: "Central Park West." The series went on, with much fanfare, last fall, and flopped. It was put on hiatus, and now network officials say it will probably be a summer replacement.</p>
