        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Pataki and Bloomberg Endorse Changes in Ground Zero Tower'' (front page, May 5):</p>
        <p>I'm glad that the construction of the Freedom Tower is profoundly delayed. Let's keep ground zero as it is for a while longer.</p>
        <p>Rudolph W. Giuliani, in his one shining moment as mayor, led us through the tragedy, kept his calm (and ours), and reminded us that we are New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>Before he left his job, he instructed New York City to build a ''soaring monumental'' memorial in the space of the World Trade Center. He meant a memorial to the innocent victims of the worst attack on the United States since Pearl Harbor.</p>
        <p>The design for the Freedom Tower, which was quickly shoved down the public's throat, never impressed me as being a ''soaring monumental'' memorial to anything.</p>
        <p>On the contrary, it looked like many of the recent grotesque glass towers that have sprouted up around Times Square -- only taller.</p>
        <p>More important, I and a great many other New Yorkers are not in the mood for something really tall in that area -- yet. We have more mourning to do.</p>
