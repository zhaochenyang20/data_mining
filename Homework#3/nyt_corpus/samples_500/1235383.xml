        <p>AT first blush, the Hudson Valley Children's Museum looks like a sprawling child-care center. With its low ceilings and fluorescent lights, the space lacks the visual drama one expects from a museum. Scuff marks on the walls and peeling exhibits suggest that the place needs a top-to-bottom makeover.</p>
        <p>But the museum, which draws 40,000 visitors a year to Nyack, in Rockland County, is focusing its attention elsewhere -- namely on a much bigger, snazzier space it plans to build up the Hudson River in the village of Haverstraw. It is now negotiating with elected officials there who are eager to have the museum move to a riverfront site at the foot of Main Street. The museum's administrators envision a whimsical, architecturally significant structure, four times the size of the current one, that would take full advantage of the spectacular vistas at the widest point of the Hudson River.</p>

        <p>AT first blush, the Hudson Valley Children's Museum looks like a sprawling child-care center. With its low ceilings and fluorescent lights, the space lacks the visual drama one expects from a museum. Scuff marks on the walls and peeling exhibits suggest that the place needs a top-to-bottom makeover.</p>
        <p>But the museum, which draws 40,000 visitors a year to Nyack, in Rockland County, is focusing its attention elsewhere -- namely on a much bigger, snazzier space it plans to build up the Hudson River in the village of Haverstraw. It is now negotiating with elected officials there who are eager to have the museum move to a riverfront site at the foot of Main Street. The museum's administrators envision a whimsical, architecturally significant structure, four times the size of the current one, that would take full advantage of the spectacular vistas at the widest point of the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the somewhat tattered appearance of the museum is quickly forgotten the moment a child engages the ingenious and playful displays.</p>
        <p>I recently brought my 2-year-old daughter, Amelia, to the museum, along with our au pair, Carly de Beer. As we approached the entrance, I joked that if the museum failed to elicit a single ''wow,'' it would have failed, since that was Amelia's expression du jour. I need not have worried. There was a steady stream of them as she tackled the exhibits and activities, which seemed designed to entertain, provoke and stimulate any number of age levels.</p>
        <p>One of the first things you encounter -- and certainly the quirkiest -- is an orange 1966 Citroen 2CV, whose dashboard is stripped of everything except the steering wheel. The roof and doors are missing, too, which made it easy for me to watch as Amelia, an avid driver, went vroom.</p>
        <p>Next, we checked out the bubble station, which lifted the concept of a soap-dipped wand to new heights. The ''wands'' in one soap-filled basin were clothes hangers and those green plastic strawberry containers. The hangers didn't work so well, but Carly blew a wonderful mound of bubbles with the strawberry basket. Another device that amazed Amelia was a ''bubble wall,'' an iridescent sheet achieved by pulling apart two long bars drenched in soap. At another bubble contraption, you step onto a platform surrounded by a large hoop marinating in soap. When you pull on a rope, the hoop rises, enclosing you in a giant ''bubble tunnel.'' Unfortunately, the tunnel kept bursting when the hoop reached two feet, apparently because the marinade did not have enough soap. (Or maybe the device was purposefully amiss, so that older children might generate just such a hypothesis.)</p>
        <p>Off we went to the ''creation station,'' a budding artist's dream studio, filled with pint-size tables and shelves bursting with paints, brushes, crayons, Magic Markers, stacks of paper, feathers, sequins, glue and clay. Parents will love the basket of smocks and the fact that this messy flurry of activity is not happening at home.</p>
        <p>After dashing off a quick work of Abstract Expressionism, Amelia was headed for the dinosaur room, where she seized on one of three large rubber eggs in a nest on the floor. One of the more effective displays was a life-size cast of an actual Nanosaurus skeleton, a dwarf lizard found in Utah. The museum staff cleverly simulated the delicate process of uncovering fossils by scattering dry rice over the cast and providing two soft brushes. A panel explained that ''scientists find fossils by digging in the earth and exposing dinosaur bones that have been turned to stone by the weather'' and the passage of time. While the message may have been lost on Amelia, she greatly enjoyed pushing around the rice.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, the one room aimed at her tender age seemed to hold the least interest, maybe because it contained many of the things Amelia sees on a daily basis, like toy phones, plastic animals, blocks and books. They could never compete with the museum's fish tank or the giant kaleidoscope or the mock submarine leading to a Hudson River exhibit or the wavy mirrors that make you look three feet tall or, in her case, a foot and a half tall.</p>
        <p>But nothing drew a reaction quite like the giant doll house behind glass, whose rooms and appliances lit up and whirred while a narrator talked about conserving energy. Five dogs watched television in the den. In the kitchen, a turkey popped out of the refrigerator to illustrate one of the house's biggest energy gobblers (get it?). In the laundry room, Mommy pedaled a stationary bicycle, while Daddy applied weatherstripping to the front door with a staple gun.</p>
        <p>''Wow!'' exclaimed Amelia, her curls flying as she jumped up and down. ''Wow! Wow! Wow!''</p>
        <p>The Hudson Valley Children's Museum is at 21 Burd Street, Nyack. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday. Admission: $5; children under 18 months, free. Small gift stand; no snack bar. Information: (845) 358-2191.</p>
