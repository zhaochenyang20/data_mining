        <p>As the billion-dollar United Nations famine-relief and peacekeeping operation in Somalia packs up and prepares to leave, no settlement is in sight for the factional violence that prompted the mission in the first place.</p>
        <p>Fighting between clans has actually increased in recent weeks in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, heightening concern that the final phase of the pullout will not be peaceful. Clan officials say a peace conference is continuing, but aid workers say it never seems to convene.</p>
        <p>Each day, meanwhile, containers filled with everything from furniture to computers and cars are being trucked down to Mogadishu's port, and at least two ships have already sailed. The last United Nations troops will be out of Somalia no later than March 31, bringing an end to an effort that at its peak in early 1993 included 25,000 American soldiers and 13,000 troops from other nations deployed as peacekeepers.</p>
        <p>When the United Nations pulls out, it will be terminating the jobs of 5,000 to 6,000 Somalis working as guards, construction workers, mechanics, cooks and office workers and another 9,000 Somalis armed and paid as police agents.</p>
        <p>Many of those workers are providing for families of up to 10 people. Relief officials say the withdrawal could leave as many as 100,000 people in Mogadishu without a source of income, and further destabilize a city riven by clan rivalry.</p>
        <p>Many Somalis are also not happy about troops taking equipment with them, and the move has set off a scramble for spoils from the two-year peacekeeping mission. General Mohammed Farah Aidid, one of two main clan leaders in Mogadishu, for example, declared in a recent broadcast on his local radio station that the United Nations equipment was a "national asset."</p>
        <p>Stealing, armed threats and extortion have become routine in the capital. "This pillaging is creating a very tense atmosphere," said Jean-Fabrice Pietri, who leads International Action Against Hunger, a French relief agency, in Somalia. "The Somalis know it's first come, first served."</p>
        <p>Relief officials say the United Nations and the United States could try to pay off both General Aidid and his rival, Mohammed Ali Mahdi, to prevent holdups and massive stealing. But both warlords only loosely control their militias.</p>
        <p>Last week, Somali militiamen attacked Bangladeshi troops when they tried to leave their base north of Mogadishu, setting off a battle with Pakistani tanks and helicopter gunships that intervened to rescue them. Relief officials and United Nations military officers said the clash arose from a rent dispute between the United Nations and elders of the Murassade clan, who were not satisfied with a prearranged settlement.</p>
        <p>Later in the week United Nations workers were held hostage for more than four hours in their compound by armed Somali security guards who were not satisfied with a proposed severance package.</p>
        <p>In the scramble for spoils, perhaps the most coveted prize -- one that Somali clans are already positioning themselves for -- is the United Nations headquarters, which occupies 80 acres of what was once the largest American embassy compound in Africa south of the Sahara.</p>
        <p>The United Nations staff will be moved temporarily in January to the city's main airport, where they will be guarded by Pakistani troops.</p>
        <p>The American Embassy compound was looted after civil war broke out in 1991, with Somalis stripping everything from plumbing to wiring. The United Nations rebuilt it from scratch, investing more than $100 million to turn it into a self-contained city with electricity, a sewage system and speed bumps.</p>
        <p>Diplomats and relief officials also predict a big struggle for Mogadishu's port and airport, lucrative links to the outside world. Many Somalis predict that the airport will be taken over by General Aidid's clan, but the fate of the port is uncertain.</p>
        <p>Relief agencies are relying on their own hard-won relationships with the various Somali clans to guarantee their security after the peacekeeping force leaves. Mr. Pietri of International Action said the agencies were trying to find ways of remaining in Somalia so as not to break the fragile support system now in place, but he is adopting a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
        <p>The French agency has been working in Somalia since early 1992 running nutritional clinics for pregnant mothers and children and working on sanitation projects. When Mr. Pietri or any of his seven Western staff members leave one of their two compounds, they travel in convoys of two or three cars with two armed guards in each vehicle.</p>
        <p>"The security situation has little chance of getting better in the next months," he said. "We are always on our guard. The most minor of rumors, and we immediately call together the Somali staff to defuse any tension."</p>
