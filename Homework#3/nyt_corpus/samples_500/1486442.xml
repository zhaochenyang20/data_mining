        <p>Lashing out at rivals within his own faction, Amram Mitzna quit today as the leader of Israel's left-of-center Labor Party -- a sign of the disarray hobbling Israel's left as the Bush administration presses a new Middle East peace plan.</p>
        <p>The resignation may eventually open the way for Labor to join the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, but seems unlikely to affect the new peace process immediately.</p>
        <p>Led by Mr. Mitzna, who became chairman of the party only last November, Labor was crushed by Mr. Sharon's Likud Party in elections in January.</p>
        <p>Since then, riven by personal rivalries and lacking a coherent message, Labor, once Israel's dominant party and now the leader of the opposition, has not exerted much influence on Mr. Sharon's right-wing government to embrace the peace initiative, known as the road map.</p>
        <p>The new peace plan calls for simultaneous concessions by Israel and the Palestinians. Mr. Sharon says he accepts the plan, but is seeking substantive changes. He insists that the Palestinians must dismantle terrorist groups before Israel eases its military actions or restrictions on Palestinians, or takes mandated steps to freeze settlement growth and remove settlement outposts built in the past two years.</p>
        <p>Assistant Secretary of State William J. Burns met today with the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, and other officials to try to advance the peace plan, which was developed by the Bush administration, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns said that President Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell had in mind steps that Israel could ''consider in its own self-interest to reinforce important steps on the Palestinian side to act decisively against terror and violence.''</p>
        <p>He specifically cited aid and relief needs. ''Obviously, the humanitarian situation for Palestinians is a very difficult one, and we very much hope that concrete steps can be taken to ease that,'' he said. Mr. Powell is expected to arrive within a week to meet separately with Mr. Sharon and the new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas.</p>
        <p>Meeting today with his cabinet ministers, Mr. Sharon repeated his demand that the Palestinians wage war against terrorist groups, not merely reach a cease-fire with them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abbas has urged Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups to give up their weapons and join the Palestinian political process. Meeting with Palestinian reporters in Ramallah today, Mr. Abbas repeated his policy that only the governing Palestinian Authority should control weapons and decide policy toward Israel.</p>
        <p>In a clash today in Nablus, in the West Bank, a 14-year-old Palestinian boy was shot dead. Palestinians in Nablus said he was throwing stones in the Balata refugee camp when Israeli troops shot him in the head. The Israeli Army said soldiers conducting an incursion were met by rioters and opened fire twice, once at a Palestinian who climbed onto an armored vehicle and once at a Palestinian who threw a firebomb.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abbas and Mr. Sharon have said they would like to meet promptly. Mr. Sharon has refused to meet Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and American officials have followed that policy since June.</p>
        <p>After taking over the leadership of Labor in November, Mr. Mitzna, 58, called for immediate negotiations with whomever the Palestinians put forward as leaders, to be followed by a unilateral Israeli separation from the Palestinian population in the West Bank and Gaza if talks failed within a year. Mr. Mitzna urged immediate withdrawal of soldiers and settlers from the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>His positions were popular, but his campaign was widely viewed as inept. Mr. Mitzna, the mayor of Haifa and a former general, was not well known nationally, and failed to convince Israelis that he could be trusted with their security. Labor's participation in Mr. Sharon's government, in which it held both the defense and foreign affairs portfolios, also undercut its ability to present itself as a stark alternative.</p>
        <p>At a news conference this evening, Mr. Mitzna predicted that Israelis would ultimately adopt Labor's land-for-peace proposals, saying that the nation must end settlements and ''separate from the Palestinians and from so many illusions.'' But in the elections, Labor fell to 19 seats from 25 in the 120-seat Parliament, while the Likud party doubled its presence, to 38 seats from its previous 19.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitzna rebuffed Mr. Sharon's invitation to join a new coalition government, saying he believed that Mr. Sharon would not make concessions like closing settlements. Other Labor leaders have been eager to join, and some have undermined Mr. Mitzna.</p>
        <p>At the news conference, Mr. Mitzna denounced Labor rivals he did not identify, accusing them of putting ''personal interests before the party.'' Mr. Mitzna said he had been urged to ''be more seamy, more manipulative.'' But, he added, ''I refuse to become the mirror reflection of my own party.''</p>
        <p>Labor is likely to pick a new leader by August, party officials said. Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, Mr. Sharon's former defense chief, lost the leadership to Mr. Mitzna in November and is expected to try to regain it.</p>
