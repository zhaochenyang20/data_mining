        <p>The father of Phillip Pannell joined the Rev. Al Sharpton and about 75 chanting supporters today in a 75-minute march from Teaneck to the Bergen County Courthouse today to protest what Mr. Sharpton called "the theatrics" in the trial of a Teaneck police officer, Gary Spath, who shot Phillip Pannell.</p>
        <p>"We're dealing with a mockery and praying for a miracle," Mr. Sharpton said from the steps of the courthouse in Hackensack, where lawyers are to make closing arguments in the trial on Monday. "We're staying in the streets until Spath pays for killing Phillip Pannell."</p>

        <p>The father of Phillip Pannell joined the Rev. Al Sharpton and about 75 chanting supporters today in a 75-minute march from Teaneck to the Bergen County Courthouse today to protest what Mr. Sharpton called "the theatrics" in the trial of a Teaneck police officer, Gary Spath, who shot Phillip Pannell.</p>
        <p>"We're dealing with a mockery and praying for a miracle," Mr. Sharpton said from the steps of the courthouse in Hackensack, where lawyers are to make closing arguments in the trial on Monday. "We're staying in the streets until Spath pays for killing Phillip Pannell."</p>
        <p>Officer Spath, who is white, is being tried for manslaughter for shooting Mr. Pannell, a 16-year-old black, in the back in April 1990. He contends he fired in self-defense during a chase because the teen-ager had reached into his jacket pocket, where a crude loaded handgun was later found.</p>
        <p>Before the three-mile march, which was orderly, Mr. Sharpton said he was upset by several factors in the trial, including an all-white jury, two jurors with relatives who are former or present police officers, the arrest of a prosecution witness by sheriff's detectives on an old probation charge moments after he testified and the appearance of Steven McDonald, a New York City policeman paralyzed by a teen-aged gunman in 1986.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pannell called himself "a peaceful man."</p>
        <p>"I'm going out for justice and I hope justice prevails," he said before the march.</p>
