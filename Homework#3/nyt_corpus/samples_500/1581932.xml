        <p>THE Cambodian director Rithy Panh doesn't want to talk about the number of dead -- the 1.7 million of his countrymen (nearly one quarter of the population) who lost their lives from 1975 to 1979, under the murderous Khmer Rouge. And though his personal losses during that time were great, he would rather not speak of them. Americans today struggle to comprehend how a few seemingly normal people, stationed in Iraq, could have so cruelly abused the prisoners they oversaw. But Mr. Rithy Panh, looking back, is faced with the transformation of vast numbers of his fellow citizens into instruments of torture and death. He finds it resists understanding.</p>
        <p>''You can kind of get it, if you consider the way people were indoctrinated, and the climate of terror that reigned at the time,'' he said in French, while in town last autumn for the screening of his documentary ''S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine,'' at the New York Film Festival. ''But genocide is something you can never fully grasp. I think it was Primo Levi who said that understanding everything is almost the same as forgiving. He didn't want that, and he was right.''</p>
        <p>''S21,'' which opens for a one-week run on Wednesday at Film Forum in Manhattan, focuses on the most notorious of the Khmer Rouge's many prisons: Tuol Sleng, also known as S21. Of an estimated 17,000 ''enemies of the state'' -- men, women, and children -- who passed through the gates of this former Phnom Penh school building, only a handful survived. This extraordinary film brings two of them -- Chum Mey, a mechanic, and Vann Nath, a painter -- together with a few of the men who once brutally guarded them. The outcome is at once a portrait of unfathomable evil, a testament to the dead and a step toward national reconciliation.</p>
        <p>The initial encounter between torturer and victim came about by accident. In 1995, Mr. Rithy Panh was in Phnom Penh shooting ''Bophana, a Cambodian Tragedy,'' a documentary tracing the life of a woman who died at the prison, now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. Mr. Vann Nath, whose large-scale paintings try to recreate the horrors of internment there, happened to be on the set the day that Him Houy, who was deputy head of prison security, came to testify. ''Suddenly, I saw Nath sitting silently on the floor, smoking cigarette after cigarette, and trembling,'' Mr. Rithy Panh recalled. ''I was afraid he might lose control, or hurt himself. Then I saw him rise, and take Houy by the shoulder to see one of his canvases. He kept asking, 'Is this true or not?' And Houy would say, 'Yes, it's true, you haven't exaggerated.'</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately,'' he continued, ''we the victims also need the words of the perpetrators, to tell their side of the story.''</p>
        <p>Born in Phnom Penh, Mr. Rithy Panh was 11 when the Khmer Rouge came to power with plans to transform Cambodia into a communist agrarian utopia. His parents and sisters, forced into the countryside along with most of the population, died in the rice fields, of famine and illnesses left untreated for lack of medicine. Some of his brothers disappeared; other family members were executed. In 1979, he escaped from a forced labor camp, finding his way to Thailand and then to Paris, where he still lives. In 1985, he was admitted to France's national film school.</p>
        <p>Since 1989, he has returned repeatedly to his homeland, making a dozen award-winning feature films and documentaries. ''The Land of the Wandering Souls'' (1999), for example, followed Cambodian workers laying a fiber optic cable; in the process, they unearthed the skulls and bones of Khmer Rouge victims, and their own memories of that era. The country's tragic past continues to haunt Mr. Rithy Panh, who said, ''Without that history, I would never have become a filmmaker.''</p>
        <p>He spent three years researching and shooting ''S21.'' ''The idea of putting victims and executioners together is very seductive, but it's also very tricky,'' he said. ''You don't want to be a voyeur. You have to develop a kind of ethic of the image.''</p>
        <p>Youk Chhang, director of the non-profit Documentation Center of Cambodia, which gathers information on Khmer Rouge atrocities, helped with the research for ''S21.''  ''It took time to find men like Houy,'' he said, ''to earn their trust and to distance ourselves from them emotionally.'' Speaking by telephone from Phnom Penh, he continued, ''The most difficult part was maintaining a professional attitude in the face of people we knew were part of a system that killed our family members.''</p>
        <p>The film begins with Mr. Him Houy sitting mute, rigid and cross-legged on the floor of his village home beside his parents -- ordinary peasants who can't understand how their son could have committed such crimes -- and absently holding his new-born child. The continuing trauma of that chapter of Cambodian history threatens to sever the natural ties between generations.</p>
        <p>In one chilling sequence, Khieu Ches, who began working as a guard at S21 when he was 12 or 13, repeats in the building's now dilapidated and empty rooms the gestures he once used there daily -- shackling and unshackling the inmates, beating and humiliating them. Beneath his imaginary blows, innumerable ghosts surge forth. ''That man, who's now about 40, had great difficulty speaking of the past,'' Mr. Rithy Panh recalled. ''But his gestures, the memory of his body, came flooding back. Because someone trained him to do this. And the memory of the body never lies.''</p>
        <p>Others interviewed include a photographer and registrar who helped keep the prison's elaborate records, a former interrogator, and a ''doctor'' whose sole mission was to revive inmates so that they could be tortured further. All were part of a perversely efficient mechanism to invent new lives for the prisoners, transforming them into ''enemies'' before killing them. Present at many of these interviews, Mr. Vann Nath -- who survived in part because Khmer Rouge officials liked the portraits they commissioned from him -- acts as the film's conscience, calmly holding up a mirror to each of his ex-captors' acts of inhumanity. Despite his wounds, he seems the only man in full possession of his past.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rithy Panh fervently supports the creation of an international tribunal to bring the aging Khmer Rouge leaders to trial. But prospects for such a trial remain uncertain. ''I am deeply dubious that these criminals will ever be brought to justice,'' said Nayan Chanda, a journalist who has written extensively on Cambodia. ''So this film will be even more appreciated as time goes by. Look, I don't know that there will ever be any accounting for what the French did in Algeria. But 'The Battle of Algiers' will remain.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rithy Panh's sense of his film's historical value is tempered by his pain. ''I do what I can,'' he said. ''Whatever happens, I belong to a generation whose sleep will be visited by nightmares. But we must not leave that legacy for our children.''</p>
