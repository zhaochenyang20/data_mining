        <p>FOR the Yankee opener at Yankee Stadium, the ultimate Yankee would soon be throwing out the ceremonial first ball. And now, in the runway behind the dugout, silver-haired Joe DiMaggio was wearing a blue blazer with a red-and-blue figured tie and a white shirt, dark gray slacks and black winged-tip shoes. At age 77, he projected class and dignity, qualities that the Yankees and all of baseball haven't always projected lately.</p>

        <p>FOR the Yankee opener at Yankee Stadium, the ultimate Yankee would soon be throwing out the ceremonial first ball. And now, in the runway behind the dugout, silver-haired Joe DiMaggio was wearing a blue blazer with a red-and-blue figured tie and a white shirt, dark gray slacks and black winged-tip shoes. At age 77, he projected class and dignity, qualities that the Yankees and all of baseball haven't always projected lately.</p>
        <p>"I haven't done this," he said, "since the 1981 World Series."</p>
        <p>His longtime friend, Barry Halper, the Yankees' new executive vice president, had asked Joe DiMaggio to throw out the first ball, maybe just as a reminder of what the Yankees once meant. Perhaps coincidentally, the Yankees responded with a 4-3 victory over the rival Red Sox and Roger Clemens, baseball's best pitcher. But the new manager, Buck Showalter, and most of the players were strangers to him.</p>
        <p>"I've never met the manager," DiMaggio said, "and there's nobody on this club I know."</p>
        <p>But they knew him. So did the fans in the crowd of 56,572, mostly from Old-Timers Days.</p>
        <p>"The first Old-Timers Day was 1946," he was saying now. "The Yankees brought in Walter Johnson to pitch to Babe Ruth, just the two of them. Babe swung and fouled it off. He swung again and fouled it off. Finally he hit a foul ball down the right-field line, but he went into his home-run trot anyway. The fans loved it.</p>
        <p>"The next year they brought in Carl Hubbell to pitch to the Babe, and Hubbell tried to trick him. Hubbell kept throwing the ball outside, but then Babe hit another foul ball down the right-field line and went into his home-run trot again. The fans loved it. But that was the last time he swung a bat. He died the next year."</p>
        <p>Babe Ruth called most people "kid," but when DiMaggio was a rookie in 1936, the Babe, just retired, visited the Yankees in spring training.</p>
        <p>"He went around the clubhouse shaking hands," DiMaggio once said, "and when he got to me, he said, 'Hiya, Joe.' I couldn't believe he knew my name."</p>
        <p>That name would join the Babe and Lou Gehrig in Yankee history, then it would be joined by Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson.</p>
        <p>Now that name had moved up the concrete steps into the Yankee dugout where only one man in a Yankee uniform yesterday, Coach Russ Meyer, had played against him. Meyer remembered pitching to DiMaggio for the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1950 World Series.</p>
        <p>"You flied out to left," Meyer said.</p>
        <p>"Why didn't you say I hit one, Russ?"</p>
        <p>Meyer must have been teasing. In two relief appearances, he never faced the Yankee center fielder. But now, one by one, Showalter and the other Yankees trotted to the first-base line to be introduced and for the 23d consecutive year Robert Merrill was booming the national anthem at the Yankee Stadium opener. By now the ultimate Yankee was holding the ceremonial first ball, and on Merrill's return to the dugout, he smiled.</p>
        <p>"I listened to every word," he told the opera singer, "and you got 'em all right."</p>
        <p>"I was going to sing it in Italian for you," Merrill said. "You know the words."</p>
        <p>Looking out across the grass, the ultimate Yankee couldn't remember any particular opening days from his career, but he remembered his impression of the first time he saw Yankee Stadium as a rookie.</p>
        <p>"The triple tier," he said, pointing down the left-field line. "I never saw Yankee Stadium until I played here."</p>
        <p>It was different then. The distances to the fences were much deeper, especially in left-center, the power alley for a right-handed hitter.</p>
        <p>"You see where the Getty sign is?" he said, pointing far beyond the left-field wall. "That's where the fence was."</p>
        <p>Not quite that far. But if the distances to the fences were the same as they are now, Joe DiMaggio would have hit more than 361 home runs. At least 100 more. But by now Buck Showalter had returned to the dugout and Barry Halper introduced him to the ultimate Yankee.</p>
        <p>"Thanks for coming today," the new manager said, shaking hands.</p>
        <p>Moments later, DiMaggio hopped to the top of the dugout steps as Bob Sheppard's voice rumbled through the public-address system:</p>
        <p>"At the area near the pitcher's mound, baseball's greatest living player will throw out the first ball, Joe DiMaggio."</p>
        <p>Despite the arthritic aches in his back and shoulders, the ultimate Yankee glided out into the caldron of cheers he has heard so often. From the grass in front of the mound, he threw the ceremonial ball to Matt Nokes, shook hands with the Yankee catcher, then hurried to the dugout.</p>
        <p>"It was painless," he said.</p>
