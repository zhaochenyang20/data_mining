        <p>Louisiana is rich in both wealth-producing and awe-inspiring natural resources, but nearly a fifth of its residents are poor, and politics and pollution often threaten its wild treasures.</p>
        <p>But in the heart of Cajun country, a wilderness preservation group and an oil company are trying to strike a balance between conservation and commerce. That is the goal of the Cypress Island Preserve, one of the nation's largest and most important wading-bird rookeries and the site of a handful of oil and gas wells, three miles from Breaux Bridge on the western edge of the Atchafalaya Basin in southwestern Louisiana.</p>
        <p>The rookery took root in ancient wetlands that exist today mostly because Texaco held on to the parcel for nearly a century. Much of the land has been deeded to the Nature Conservancy of Louisiana, with the latest donation in March.</p>
        <p>The bird colony, which roosts in the preserve's Lake Martin, is being closely watched. Since wading birds are at the top of the food chain, said Dr. Bruce Fleury, a visiting instructor in ecology and evolutionary biology at Tulane University, the birds ''are the canary in the coal mine for the wetland habitat.''</p>
        <p>The viability of the rookery and its hardwood ecosystem will depend on how well the birds and other wildlife fare with oil and gas wells for neighbors, with the commotion of growing numbers of tourists, with stagnating water and with the anger of neighboring farmers who say the birds look at their crawfish ponds as all-you-can-eat buffets.</p>
        <p>The habitat of Cypress Island -- not a natural island, but named for its stand of cypress -- has mostly thrived. Starting in the 1970's, bird populations there boomed with the rise in nearby crawfish farming, Dr. Fleury said. The rookery appears to have held an average of 15,000 birds since 1996, said Dr. Thomas Michot, a wildlife biologist with the National Wetlands Research Center, part of the federal Interior Department. Researchers suspect that the number may have dropped recently and will begin a new count in August.</p>
        <p>In many quarters, the idea of oil and gas drilling in ecologically sensitive areas like the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a hot political issue.</p>
        <p>''There's no such thing as risk-free oil and gas development,'' said Jim Waltman, director of the national wildlife refuge program for the Wilderness Society in Washington.</p>
        <p>But residents of the Lake Martin area seem to take the drilling in stride. A recent report on preserving the area, prepared for homeowners and politicians, did not even mention the nearby oil and gas operations.</p>
        <p>Preserving Cypress Island is crucial to stemming the decline of the Lower Mississippi Valley ecosystem, said Dr. Keith Ouchley, executive director of the state's Nature Conservancy. Cypress Island is ''one of the last remaining large blocks of hardwood forest'' in an area from southern Illinois to the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, Dr. Ouchley said.</p>
        <p>Lake Martin was formed more than 6,000 years ago in a Mississippi River flood. It was a slough until 1953, when the state encircled 765 acres with a levee, creating 200 acres of open water, now used as a recreational area. The birds nest primarily in 250 acres at the southern end of the lake that Texaco donated to the Nature Conservancy.</p>
        <p>On a recent visit, 10,000 to 20,000 or so little blue herons, great blue herons, cattle egrets, snowy egrets, tricolored herons, black-crowned night herons and yellow-crowned night herons filled spindly buttonbush branches, just yards from the preserve's heavily traveled road. They were joined by 100 or so pairs of gaudily pink roseate spoonbills. Great egrets nested above the fray in stout tupelo cypress boughs.</p>
        <p>The lake area supports other wildlife, including 1,800 to 2,000 alligators that float at the edges of the roosts, ready to snap up wayward hatchlings. Migratory songbirds nest in the spring and refuel in the fall in the dense woods, Dr. Ouchley said. Two hundred species have been identified, including warblers, vireos, flycatchers, gnatcatchers, grosbeaks and buntings.</p>
        <p>The Louisiana Nature Conservancy began its stewardship in 1994, when Texaco gave it 2,600 acres, including Lake Martin. With the oil and gas deposits running low, Texaco donated 6,000 acres more, mostly south of the lake, in March. Once the paperwork is complete, the conservancy will have 8,600 acres, plus a few hundred it bought on its own.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to show that you can balance competing needs in an environmentally sensitive area,'' said Beth Picou Claude, a Texaco spokeswoman in New Orleans. The company kept the mineral rights, which it leases to EnerVest Management Partners, which is based in Houston. It has also given the conservancy  $500,000 for community education.</p>
        <p>The Louisiana conservancy has no legal authority over oil production on its preserve, said Cindy Brown, the  chapter's Cypress Island project director. But she said EnerVest had been cooperative when asked to avoid certain areas. EnerVest's chief operating officer, Mark Hauser, said, ''We really do respect the beauty of the environment.''</p>
        <p>EnerVest's area for oil and gas production is in the preserve but across a highway and three miles from Lake Martin and its rookery. Eight wells each occupy a 2,000-square-foot clearing, and short pipelines lead to storage tanks, where oil and gas are trucked out. The three active wells pump a total of 1,500 barrels per day, said Dean Broussard, EnerVest's production manager.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hauser said that any new wells would be drilled directionally, slanting through existing wellheads.</p>
        <p>The birds' other neighbors, the crawfish farmers, cannot help being annoyed when they see thousands of birds gorging on crawfish when the  artificial ponds are drawn down after the spring harvest, said Dr. Jay Huner, director of the Crawfish Research Center at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette. The state occasionally gives farmers permits to  kill nuisance birds, but farmers say it is hard to make an impact.</p>
        <p>Jeff Durand, manager of 1,800 acres of crawfish at Durand Ponds, 10 miles from the lake, said noisemaker shells and pyrotechnics had not scared off the waders.</p>
        <p>From the birds' point of view, the 17,000 acres of crawfish ponds  around Lake Martin provide a smorgasbord of small fish, snails, aquatic insects, frogs and crawfish. The only formal study of the birds' effect on the crawfish ponds was done in 1985 by Richard Martin, who is now director of conservation programs for the state Nature Conservancy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin estimated that wading birds consumed 5 to 10 percent of a farm's production. But he also found that birds thinned out the ponds. That process, he contends, allows a more profitable harvest of larger crawfish. He added that his study was ''crying out for replication.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Huner agreed. Even if remaining crawfish grow larger, he said, farmers may still lose money.</p>
        <p>In the absence of firm data, Dr. Huner has been trying to convince farmers that they can thwart waders by digging deeper ponds and choking the ponds with vegetation. ''The answer is not killing things,'' he said, ''but managing around them.''</p>
        <p>Crawfish are essential for the birds, and the birds are crucial to plans to maintain Lake Martin as a tourist attraction. Much of the area used to be a trash dump. Now, about 90,000 vehicles per year cruise the  levee's Rookery Road. But there is concern that there may be a Yellowstone in the making.</p>
        <p>''Some swamp tour operators were boldly chain-sawing their way into the nesting areas,'' said Theresa Privat, who owns property on the lake and is president of the Lake Martin Advisory Council. A state rule adopted last spring prohibits people from entering the nesting area from February to July.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the lake is slowly dying; it has no natural drainage and receives tons of bird droppings a  year. So the conservancy will start draining Lake Martin into surrounding wetlands this fall and will bring in fresh water from a canal.</p>
        <p>Though the birds seem comfortable with their less than pristine neighborhood, the idea is to keep their habitat as quiet as possible. ''Nobody knows what these birds are thinking,'' Mr. Martin said, ''so we try to err on the side of conservation and limit disturbance.''</p>
        <p>That means restraining encroachment, whether from overeager tourists or oil company workers.</p>
        <p>So far, Dr. Fleury said, ''even though it's fragile, everything at this point is looking good.''</p>
