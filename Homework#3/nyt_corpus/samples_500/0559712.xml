        <p>Lisa Narducci gets up at 5 every morning to commute to the Coney Island Water Pollution Control Project. With the acrid stench of sewage rising around her, she drills and saws through plywood, crawls over hot concrete and lifts wooden planks -- all part of her day's work as a carpenter.</p>
        <p>There are no separate changing rooms for her or the other five women on the job. There are no separate bathrooms. The trailers have pin-ups of naked women on the wall. Sometimes, a co-worker or supervisor says he doubts she can do her job.</p>
        <p>Still, she is glad to be there.</p>
        <p>Ms. Narducci and other women in the building trades find themselves fighting battles they thought they won years ago. They fight for the few jobs left in the depressed construction market. They face competitive fears and pejorative comments from their male co-workers. And they are reluctant to complain about working conditions or harassment, believing that troublemakers get dismissed quickly when there are plenty of unemployed replacements. An Uneasy Peace</p>
        <p>After winning a foothold in the late 1970's and achieving an uneasy peace with male co-workers and bosses in the 1980's, women in the construction industry are seeing their numbers dwindle and their gains disappear. Some quit because the early hours, heavy lifting and danger of the work were not to their liking. But others left because they tired of what the felt was a hostile environment.</p>
        <p>There are no definite figures about the number of women in the construction trades in New York City, in large part because union officials say they do not track their membership by sex. In 1990, the NOW Legal Defense Fund estimated that women made up about 4 percent of the almost 100,000 workers in the skilled trades, a number with which most industry experts agree. But they say the number has dropped since then.</p>
        <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which only keeps nationwide figures on the women in the construction trades, says women have dropped back from the minuscule advances they had made in the 1980's. The most recent figures show that women held 81,000 jobs in the building trades in 1991, or 1.9 percent of the total, down from 2 percent the year before.</p>
        <p>In New York City, women may be having a particularly hard time because of the hard times hurting all construction workers: union officials estimate that between 50 and 60 percent of the work force is currently unemployed.</p>
        <p>"Women who would have entered the industry are not entering because of the job situation," said Raymond O'Kane, assistant to the president of the District Council of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters. "And women who are part of the union but have a family to feed or themselves to feed are dropping out because they can't find work."</p>
        <p>But Peggy Crull, the director of research for the city's Human Rights Commission, said the recession was not totally to blame. 'Women Are Discouraged</p>
        <p>"It's not that the numbers are dropping because of the recession," said Ms. Crull, who is compiling a report from hearings the commission held in 1990 on minorities in the construction trades. "The numbers are dropping because women are discouraged. My sense is that women are being discouraged."</p>
        <p>The women who do remain readily admit such discouragement. Ms. Narducci, who began training as a carpenter 11 years ago, said she was less willing than she used to be to ask for such things as separate bathrooms.</p>
        <p>"I am sticking my neck out," she said. "Here I am waltzing onto the job, telling them to hire more women, and now I want a bathroom."</p>
        <p>And the stereotypes women encounter on the job have not changed very much, despite years of women getting the work done.</p>
        <p>Paul McEnery, project manager for the Perini Corporation, the contractor on the Coney Island sewage plant site, which is actually in Sheepshead Bay, said women cannot be expected to lift 200-pound slabs of concrete, for instance. But Ms. Narducci and another carpenter, Dolores Laureano, built a small upper floor of the plant out of those very concrete slabs.</p>
        <p>Ms. Narducci said one of her foremen had questioned whether she could carry the wooden poles used to make scaffolding.</p>
        <p>"That really upset me, because once they think you can't handle something, then you're expendable," she said. "Even if the doubts are only in their imagination."</p>
        <p>One of the general foremen on the site, Gene Kelly, said he could trust Ms. Narducci and Ms. Laureano to do any work he gave them. "The only problem," he joked, "is I can't yell at them the same way I do my other workers." Why? "I'm afraid they would cry."</p>
        <p>In the face of such enduring stereotypes and of continued harassment, women are leaving or not entering the trades, and those that remain are trying to maintain the few concessions they have won over the years. Many of them regret that they did not do more to recruit other women in the 1980's, when openings were plentiful during the city's building boom.</p>
        <p>"We all think that the heyday was in the 80's, but it wasn't much of a heyday," said Barbara Trees, a carpenter. "We were all learning our trades, trying to survive on our job sites, trying to get used to it all. I don't think we had a chance to build a movement."</p>
        <p>That is why she and Ms. Narducci began a women's committee of carpenters this summer. They want to push to maintain the number of women in the trade and to look for ways to recruit more.</p>
        <p>Both women were surprised when the District Council of the union responded favorably to their idea for a committee. In many ways, the women and their union leaders acknowledge they are working toward more common goals than ever before.</p>
        <p>The women want job security and better working conditions, and they know the union must be part of providing those. The union leaders need more strong pro-union employees and enough women to fill hiring goals on government jobs, and they realize that their female members can help them with both.</p>
        <p>At the Coney Island water pollution plant, as on most federally financed projects, the declining number of women vying for jobs means it is more difficult to meet the 6.9 percent hiring goal fixed by the Department of Labor. There are more than 90 workers on the site, 6 of whom are women.</p>
        <p>That may sound like it is easier for women to get hired these days but that is not always the case. For instance, the contractor was only able to meet the goal when Ms. Narducci, who was not sent by her union, asked for a job and then recommended another female carpenter.</p>
        <p>Most contractors do not have to meet hiring goals, because they only exist on Federal jobs. And they say they are glad to avoid the problem.</p>
        <p>"It's difficult to set a number or a percentage and say there have to be that many women on the site," said K. Robert Najarian, a vice president of A-J Contracting Company Inc. "There may not be enough women in certain trades. That may create some false economics."</p>
        <p>Frank McArdle, managing director of the General Contractors Association, said the contractors his trade group represents -- more than 700 heavy and highway construction companies -- must comply with Federal hiring numbers on Government jobs. He said the only trade that has caused a consistent problem has been the iron workers, who have had difficulty finding women who can pass the agility and confidence tests. The union and the State Department of Transportation have had meetings to discuss recruiting more qualified women for the trade.</p>
        <p>Some women resent the pressure to put them on Government-financed jobs. But private jobs have all but ceased in New York, as have those financed by the city. And with them have gone most chances for younger women who want to break into the building trades. The electricians' union, for example, stopped its apprenticeship program this year.</p>
        <p>Many contractors are also hiring nonunion employees, which means there is even less pressure to hire women.</p>
        <p>Nontraditional Employment for Women, a local organization that provides training for women, has cut back its programs for would-be construction workers. In July the group began a new program to train women for maintenance and repair jobs, which pay less than construction jobs but have more openings at this time.</p>
        <p>Even more experienced women are becoming fed up with continuing battles on the work site and in the union hall.</p>
        <p>"There is a high dropout rate among women in general," said Laura Kelber, who has worked as an electrician for 11 years, "especially when they become journeywomen and realize that they're not going to be treated any better."</p>
        <p>Mr. McArdle of the contractors' association said he did not see the high dropout rate in the construction trades as a gender issue. "A lot of people decide this is not what they want to be doing for the rest of their lives," he said.</p>
        <p>But the women who remain in the construction trades say the benefits are worth fighting for, and many remain optimistic. "Think about those women 90 years ago, who died in jail on hunger strikes for their rights," Ms. Narducci said. "It could be worse."</p>
        <p>The women point to the high pay they receive for the work they love and say that is all they've ever wanted -- to be able to do their work and earn wages equal to men's.</p>
        <p>"Women working in the construction trades was not a romantic idea," Ms. Trees said. "We were saying, 'If you won't pay us equally for so-called women's work, we will go where you are and you will have to pay us the same.' "</p>
