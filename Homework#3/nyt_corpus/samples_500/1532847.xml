        <p>A GOOD seven hours remained before the close of the polls yesterday, but Patrick Hurley, the Republican candidate for the City Council in Woodside and its environs, needed sustenance. With the misty rain outside, it was proving to be a soft day, and a hard one as well.</p>
        <p>The waitress at Shane's Bakery, just off Roosevelt Avenue, presented him first with a pot of tea. Then came a plate heavy with coarse-cut bacon, plump sausages, and two eggs staring right at him, as if to say:</p>
        <p>What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be out campaigning?</p>
        <p>He grabbed a piece of toast and poked one right in the yolk.</p>
        <p>Somewhere out there, his opponent, a young Democratic incumbent named Eric Gioia, was shaking hands, thanking people for coming out on such a raw day, asking them for their vote. He in his dark blue suit, white shirt, and red tie, ignoring the inclement weather because that is one of the strange ways that politicians show they care.</p>
        <p>If, God forbid, Mr. Gioia caught a cold, well at least he had raised enough money -- more than $300,000 -- to cover the cost of some Robitussin. He also had enough Gioia signs plastered around the district to spare a few for a nice warm fire. And, of course, he could always get a toasty group hug from that army of 200 volunteers out there, all wearing ''Eric Gioia Team'' T-shirts.</p>
        <p>And what did Patrick Hurley have? About $12,000 in contributions, about one twenty-fifth of what Mr. Gioia had raised. About 10 volunteers, including some not even from his district: Dermot from County Kerry and upstate; Gerald, from County Mayo and the Bronx.</p>
        <p>As for signs, Mr. Hurley had just been informed that the folks at a local restaurant had removed his placard Monday night -- but left a Gioia one intact.</p>
        <p>''And I probably eat in there three times a week,'' said Mr. Hurley, 41, his brogue as heavy as the meal before him. He muttered something about never eating there again, and punctured a sausage with his fork.</p>
        <p>There was a time when it seemed that you had to be an Irish-American and a Democrat to be elected to the City Council from the 26th District in Queens, despite its healthy ethnic diversity. You had to be able to name the county in Ireland where your people were from; you had to be able to at least mouth the lyrics to ''The Wild Colonial Boy.''</p>
        <p>That effectively ended in 2001 when Mr. Gioia, a lawyer, challenged the Democratic Party leadership and defeated several candidates with Irish surnames. He had his own kind of name recognition. His family has owned the Nunziato flower shop on Roosevelt Avenue for more than a century. He went to P.S. 11; he attends Mass at St. Sebastian's.</p>
        <p>No Democrat challenged him this year, leaving the task to Mr. Hurley, a security director for a hotel. Mr. Hurley presented himself as an Irish immigrant who was grounded both in Woodside and in traditional values, as opposed to Mr. Gioia, whom he portrayed as an out-of-touch liberal who had already set his sights on higher office.</p>
        <p>''Really, really from the neighborhood,'' read Mr. Hurley's campaign literature. ''Not just passing through.''</p>
        <p>MR. HURLEY flashed a mischievous smile, there above his yolk-stained plate, when asked whether he enjoyed the support of Democrats of Irish descent still smarting from the success of young Mr. Gioia, who is 30. Such information, he said, was ''privileged.''</p>
        <p>''Let's put it this way,'' he said. ''There are people in the Democratic Party who'd like to say 'au revoir' to Eric.''</p>
        <p>Among them, presumably, was the woman who approached Mr. Gioia last weekend to criticize him for favoring the right to abortion -- just as he was about to receive holy communion at the altar of St. Sebastian's. But in the campaign of 2003, her action was a mere blip of opposition in the continuing ascendance of that local boy whose family owns the flower shop.</p>
        <p>As he sipped the last of his tea, Mr. Hurley seemed to sense that he had as much chance against Mr. Gioia as the eggs had had against his fork. After joking that his last-minute campaigning would include some praying, he paid his bill and went out into the midafternoon wetness.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, Mr. Hurley pulled his green van in front of a polling station where Mr. Gioia was campaigning. Then, as his opponent watched in disbelief, a red-faced Mr. Hurley climbed up a streetlamp to rip down a Gioia sign.</p>
        <p>It was unclear whether this gesture reflected defiance or futility. Perhaps the kindest interpretation is simply that Mr. Hurley's late Irish breakfast had not agreed with him.</p>
