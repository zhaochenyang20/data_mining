        <p>Warning that its third-quarter results would be dismal, the Gillette Company said yesterday that it would cut 4,700 jobs, or 11 percent of its worldwide work force, as it reorganized its business.</p>
        <p>The company, the world's largest maker of blades and razors, said earnings for the quarter would be down 20 percent from the quarter a year ago, largely as a result of a $535 million charge against earnings to pay for the cutbacks and reorganization.</p>
        <p>Analysts said they were surprised by how bleak the earnings outlook was. Gillette was expected to earn 40 cents a share in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, based on a consensus of analysts polled by First Call, an investment research company, compared with 38 cents a share, adjusted for a stock split, a year earlier. Gillette also said it expected to report a decline of 6 percent to 7 percent in revenue for the quarter, from $2.4 billion a year ago.</p>
        <p>Gillette plans to close 14 plants and 12 warehouses and eliminate or consolidate about 30 office facilities worldwide. The company, which is based in Boston, did not say which plants and offices would be closed. The cost cuts, which are part of the company's second reorganization in five years, will result in annual savings of more than $200 million, with a third of that coming next year and the balance by 2001.</p>
        <p>The company also said its earnings would grow by the ''low double digits'' in the fourth quarter, but it had expected to earn 41 cents a share, based on the First Call consensus.</p>
        <p>Gillette announced the profit warning and the cutbacks after the stock market closed. Earlier, its shares rose $1.6875, to $40, on the New York Stock Exchange. Third-quarter results are scheduled to be released on Oct. 15.</p>
        <p>Calling it a ''very poor quarter we'd like to forget,'' Alfred M. Zeien, the chairman and chief executive officer of the company, said the results could be attributed to several factors. First, the company's strategy to accelerate the introduction its new Mach 3 shaving system resulted in huge one-time costs. At the same time, Mr. Zeien said, consumers have been stocking up on the new razor, which was sold with at least a month's worth of blades, and many have not yet had to purchase replacements. In addition, economic instability in some countries has hurt wholesale demand overseas.</p>
        <p>In a conference call with financial analysts yesterday, Mr. Zeien sought to assure investors that the fundamentals of Gillette's business remained strong and that the Mach 3 shaver was meeting sales expectations. He also assured analysts that the reorganization would bring about a more competitive company.</p>
        <p>The changes, Mr. Zeien said, ''will allow Gillette to become a more cost-effective competitor, help Gillette to achieve its aggressive strategic plans, recapture the sales and earnings growth momentum and enhance the company's ability to improve shareholder return.''</p>
        <p>But the assurances did little to pacify analysts, who said they had not been expecting an earnings drop of as much as 20 percent and had little warning from Gillette's management that estimates were so far off target.</p>
        <p>''There has been a lack of information over the last quarter,'' said William Steele, who follows the company for Buckingham Research. ''Basically I think investors have been too optimistic based upon the company's guidance.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the job cuts and factory closings, Gillette said it was realigning its management. The company, which manufactures the best-selling Sensor razor line as well as Duracell batteries and Oral B dental products, said its six global business management units would be organized under two executive vice presidents. In addition, the consolidation of the commercial operations will result in five geographic groups organized under two additional executive vice presidents.</p>
        <p>The groups will sell the company's entire product line within their geographic territories instead of having distinct selling organizations with separate administrative functions in one territory. The four executive vice presidents will report to Michael C. Hawley, president and chief operating officer.</p>
        <p>''Under the new organization structure, there will be one Gillette Company in each of the major geographic regions,'' Mr. Hawley said.</p>
