        <p>TWO of the dresser drawers in my 12-year-old daughter's room were broken. It was not the drawers' fault, nor Annie's. It was time.

If that baby boy lay on that dresser today, his size 12 feet would scrape the floor.</p>
        <p>So we threw out the dresser, which led to a reorganization of Annie's clothes, which somehow turned into a major revamping of Annie's room that took most of the weekend. As Annie noted about two hours in, ''This turned out to be an official room-cleaning project, didn't it, Dad?''</p>

        <p>TWO of the dresser drawers in my 12-year-old daughter's room were broken. It was not the drawers' fault, nor Annie's. It was time. The top of the waist-high dresser had served as a changing table for our four children, and our oldest is now a college freshman. If that baby boy lay on that dresser today, his size 12 feet would scrape the floor.</p>
        <p>So we threw out the dresser, which led to a reorganization of Annie's clothes, which somehow turned into a major revamping of Annie's room that took most of the weekend. As Annie noted about two hours in, ''This turned out to be an official room-cleaning project, didn't it, Dad?''</p>
        <p>Our timing was good. It was that cold, icy March weekend when we were happy to stay inside and wait for spring.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, more change was afoot than just the seasons.</p>
        <p>From under Annie's bed we pulled out several wicker bins where we'd been storing her American Girl dolls, a metric ton of American Girl clothes and an astonishing amount of other stuff.</p>
        <p>''Which dolls are these?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''Duh, Dad, don't you know anything about American Girl?'' They were Felicity and Kit, which I used to know, when they were on top of the bed. All this, of course, was way too valuable to throw away, so it got put into plastic containers and stored in a crawl space under the house.</p>
        <p>''What's this?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''Clothes that don't fit any more that Mom wants to keep because she likes the fabric.'' Under the house.</p>
        <p>The deeper we dug, the more complex the decisions.</p>
        <p>''Is it O.K. if I throw away my horse collection?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>''Really?'' I said.</p>
        <p>Horses had been her passion. She had amassed dozens of stuffed and model horses, subscribed to horse magazines, read horse books. While my wife and I are not horse people, her Grandma Libby was a competitive rider, and Annie took lessons during summer vacations in Michigan.</p>
        <p>At 10, she'd been so excited about going to horseback riding camp. But after a week we received one of those pro forma chatty camp letters with a single worrisome line wedged in the middle: ''It's not what I thought!'' By the time we picked her up at the end of Week 2, she was done with horses. We never knew exactly why, though there were hints, like we'd sent her with the wrong kind of boots.</p>
        <p>The verdict now was final. Much of the horse collection went into the trash, and her prized horse books (''Misty of Chincoteague,'' ''Stormy, Misty's Foal,'' ''Riding Days,'' ''I'll Take Cappy,'' ''Trickster'') were sent off to a bookcase in the back of the house.</p>
        <p>We cleared off the top of the new bureau for makeup, nail polish, jewelry and body splashes.</p>
        <p>We found many things that were definitely lost for good, including her iPod and ''Five Novels'' by Daniel Pinkwater, at 648 pages a hard book to lose.</p>
        <p>We stored her blocks, though she asked to keep the five that spelled ''A-N-N-I-E.'' We found the dust cover to ''Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,'' a favorite, but could not find the actual book. We stopped to read several picture books and Annie decided not to send them away, because sometimes at night, when she is too tired to read a novel, she likes remembering her picture books.</p>
        <p>She pulled out ''Puss in Boots,'' read some and said, ''Dad, this is just like 'Shrek 2.' ''</p>
        <p>We had to reorganize the bookcases, because while everyone tells me, ''She doesn't look like you, she's pretty like her mom,'' she does get at least one genetic trait from Dad. ''I hate when books are slanted, absolutely hate it, '' she said.</p>
        <p>As we packed up the Beanie Babies collection, she said, ''Remember how Uncle Harry said they're going to be worth a fortune someday?''</p>
        <p>We were paralyzed by some items. What to do with the dollhouse that her mom had worked so hard to build and paint and outfit? Annie hasn't played with it for years, but it was too big to go under the house. (The answer turned out to be nothing; it's still perched on her crafts armoire.)</p>
        <p>We emptied the crafts armoire, sorting out the beads and wire and hemp she uses to make her jewelry. What had looked dazzling to a 10-year-old eye looked cheap to her 12-year-old eye, and we agreed to keep only the most beautiful plastic beads. We tested out her markers to see which were still good, and stuck them along with the colored pencils in several big coffee mugs.</p>
        <p>We washed the linen liners of the baskets and, in place of the dolls under the bed, filled one with her favorite oversized T-shirts and the other with her sports uniforms (soccer, basketball, lacrosse, volleyball, softball).</p>
        <p>I'd been so consumed with getting the room organized that it took a while to realize what was actually going on here: We were saying goodbye to the girl and bracing for the teenager. Gone is the Annie who would go up to her room, read for 20 minutes, then call down, ''Dad, guess what page I'm on now  higher, Dad  higher  way higher.''</p>
        <p>Arriving is the Annie who ordered a bomber jacket online from Hollister and said, ''The e-mail said 7 to 10 days. So by now, it's 5 to 8.''</p>
        <p>Toward the end, we found an old hand-drawn poster behind the armoire. When the kids were in elementary school, we used to get large poster boards from King's Pharmacy, and Annie and her brothers and I would lie on the floor drawing together, creating wild, elaborate jungle scenes full of William Steiglike creatures. Sometimes we would work on one drawing for weeks, then put several together to make a mural.</p>
        <p>The two of us studied this one, remembering which beasts she'd drawn, which were mine and which were her brothers'. (''Remember this one, Dad? That's definitely Adam.'')</p>
        <p>''Where do we put it?'' I asked, thinking we might hang it up.</p>
        <p>''Throw it away, Dad,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Really?''</p>
        <p>Twenty-five years before, when I was single and in my 20's, I'd gone back to my family home in Boston to help my mom clean the junk from her attic. My dad had died not long before; she was having a hard time and said I could get rid of whatever I thought should go.</p>
        <p>What I remember most was how fast I worked, how decisive I was and my feeling of satisfaction at seeing three dozen bags of junk by the curb for the trash man.</p>
        <p>This time, I wasn't so surefooted. Though I had permission, I couldn't throw away that jungle drawing, so I carried it down to my office and slid it behind a bookcase.</p>
