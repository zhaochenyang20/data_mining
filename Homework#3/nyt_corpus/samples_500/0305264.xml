        <p>LEAD: The announcement last month by the board of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts that it would not renew the contract of Ralph P. Davidson, the center's chairman and president, underlines the special problems of that gleaming culture palace on the banks of the Potomac.</p>
        <p>The announcement last month by the board of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts that it would not renew the contract of Ralph P. Davidson, the center's chairman and president, underlines the special problems of that gleaming culture palace on the banks of the Potomac.</p>
        <p>The board's decision not to renew Mr. Davidson's three-year contract when it expires in February 1991 came after months of rumors of trustee dissatisfaction, both with his general style of operation and with his slowness in raising funds for the center's $100 million endowment.</p>
        <p>An unusual blend of the ceremonial and the commercial, the center is a memorial to former President John F. Kennedy, a major tourist attraction and a national cultural center. Even though it receives virtually no Government funds, the center is expected not only to present the best of the performing arts and serve a cultural constituency around the nation, but also to come up with enough box-office revenue to stay in the black (top ticket prices range from $65 for opera to $31.50 for symphony concerts). Private Contributions Needed</p>
        <p>In addition, the center faces the task of raising 20 percent of its annual operating budget of $57 million from individual, corporate and foundation contributions. The rest of the money comes from ticket sales, concessions like restaurants, shops and a parking garage, and gifts from individuals. The center receives $5 million a year from the Park Service for maintenance of the building and grounds, but must pay back a bit more than $1 million as its share of the cost of maintaining its theaters, backstage areas and offices.</p>
        <p>As the board begins its search for a new chairman, some trustees have proposed that the job be split between a president responsible for the artistic programming and a chairman responsible for fund raising and financial stability.</p>
        <p>James Evans, a former chief executive officer of Union Pacific who heads the search committee, said that proposal was still on the table. ''We are still getting organized and we need to have a consensus view of what we really need,'' he explained in an interview. ''We do have Marta Istomin as artistic director and she certainly understands music and dance programing. But we are looking at a very difficult job. There is no built-in constituency. We don't have large corporations based in Washington and we need to raise 3 million corporate dollars each year just to keep the doors open. It would be ideal if we could find Mr. or Mrs. or Miss Wonderful who possessed all those qualities.''</p>
        <p>Suggested names, from near and far, are already being floated, Mr. Evans said. For example, he received a telephone call from a prominent Washington lawyer suggesting Robert Bernstein, who resigned as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Random House earlier this month. ''I told him I would add his name to the list,'' Mr. Evans said. ''We hope to have a preliminary report ready for the April board meeting,'' Difficult Questions</p>
        <p>For 16 years the center and Roger L. Stevens, its founding chairman, were an inseparable pair. Now, as it looks ahead to its 20th birthday in 1991, the center is facing some hard questions about its place in the cultural scheme of things. Should it continue to try to mount the glittering international festivals and other spectacular attractions of its earlier years? Should it seek to develop a National Theater? Should it concentrate on the encouragement of young artists and the seeking out of new talent?</p>
        <p>''For so long the Kennedy Center operated under the aegis of its founding father with his sense of mission, but like a lot of other organizations it has now come into its adulthood,'' said Anne Murphy, director of the American Arts Alliance, an arts advocacy group based in Washington. ''When you move from the founding vision, there is a period when it is necessary to reassess what you really need.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidson, a former executive of Time Inc., had no professional arts background, but he was seen as someone who could put his corporate contacts to work in behalf of the center. He succeeded Mr. Stevens, a longtime Broadway producer who was the driving force behind the move to build of the cultural center. As chairman, Mr. Stevens not only oversaw the center's theatrical programming but was also a master at courting Congress and attracting corporate dollars. 'Following a Legend'</p>
        <p>''In Ralph's defense, you would have to say that following a legend would have been very difficult for anybody,'' said Harry C. McPherson Jr., general counsel for the board and a former trustee. It was Mr. Stevens who brought Mr. Davidson to the attention of the board when its search committee, in Mr. McPherson's words, ''struck out'' after an 18-month search.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stevens concedes that overseeing as complex an institution as the Kennedy Center is not easy. ''There are problems not readily seen by outsiders,'' said Mr. Stevens, who keeps an office at the center but who has returned to his first love, producing Broadway shows. ''Every artistic decision is a business decision and every business decision an artistic decision. It's a tightrope - to say nothing of having people enjoy what you bring.''</p>
        <p>''And no one realizes the difficulty of raising money for the arts,'' he added, ''but the last thing I wanted was Government money for our productions.''</p>
        <p>The center, as part of its mandated role as a national showcase, contributes $3 million to $4 million each year to educational and public service programs. For example, it underwrites the annual American College Festival, a half-price ticket program for students and the elderly, and free children and family programing as well as free holiday music festivals. The Department of Education does contribute almost $1 million toward the center's educational programs. The Fund for New American Plays, supported by the center and American Express, helps regional theaters mount new plays and has awarded $820,500 in grants to 19 theaters since its inception in 1985. Pop Programs Criticized</p>
        <p>The center, whose six theaters are rarely dark, has been criticized for occasionally programming conventional pop concerts and commercial theatrical hits in the hope of offseting box-office losses of other works. But it is prepared to take a financial risk for certain shows. For example, the center has rescued a production of ''Sarafina!,'' the black South African musical, by agreeing to guarantee the production against loss. The show, which now is to open May 1 at the center, was originally scheduled for the National Theater here, but both the National and the Shubert Organization, which books and manages the National, backed away from such a guarantee.</p>
        <p>''It's an impossible situation,'' said Martin Feinstein, general director of the Washington Opera, who served as the center's executive director of performing arts until 1980, importing such major attractions as the La Scala and Bolshoi operas.</p>
        <p>''The Congressional mandate calls for the best in ballet, the best in music and the best of all the things that are going on around the country,'' Mr. Feinstein said. ''But you have to go for the commercial ventures in order to make a profit to present the things you should be presenting.''</p>
        <p>''In Ottawa,'' he continued, ''the national cultural center gets very strong support from the Canadian Government. In New York, Lincoln Center gets a good sum of money from the New York State Arts Council as well as from the city. Here nothing is subsidized.''</p>
        <p>Six years ago, Mr. Stevens hired the iconoclastic director Peter Sellars to, as Mr. Stevens put it, ''shake up the place a bit.'' He turned over the theatrical programming to Mr. Sellars, with the aim of emphasizing noncommercial, experimental work, collaborating with theaters across the country. But the venture, which produced both raves and grumbles from the critics, met with indifference at the box office and was abandoned after two years.</p>
        <p>Except for a $1.9 million deficit in 1984, the center has managed to break even. A dozen or more national and regional ballet companies as well as contemporary dance groups are presented each year and the center is rich in musical offerings, from opera and symphonic orchestras to chamber music, recitals and jazz.</p>
        <p>''We must look for funding for almost all our dance performances and much of our music programming,'' said Mrs. Istomin. ''In recent years, we have been focusing on young American artists and young companies and brought fewer foreign companies here. But within this past year we've had the Kirov Ballet, the London Festival Ballet, Kabuki from Japan, and the Berlin Opera.''</p>
        <p>Aaron Sorkin's play ''A Few Good Men'' had its world premiere here, with President and Mrs. Bush quietly dropping by; August Wilson's ''Piano Lesson'' opened Nov. 13; ''Annie 2'' is scheduled for Dec. 22 and a new musical, ''Shogun,'' is to open in April. ''Sheer Madness,'' a farce, has been playing for two years.</p>
        <p>The Kennedy Center ''produces'' as well as ''presents,'' and is still collecting on its investment in the original ''Annie.'' This year it is co-producing ''Shogun'' and has put money into ''A Few Good Men'' and ''Annie 2'' as well as a number of other productions. Competition at Home</p>
        <p>''We don't consider ourselves as just presenters,'' said Drew Murphy, general manager of theater operations. ''As a national culture center we feel part of our job is to help along young producers, playwrights and composers. Sometimes we can give them a financial boost to get a project on.''</p>
        <p>Douglas Wheeler, managing director for the Washington Performing Arts Society, an organization that has been importing artists to the capital for 25 years, sees another challenge on the horizon for the Kennedy Center. He points to the half-dozen new theaters planned for the Washington area, including a 2,000-seat theater in the new International Cultural and Trade Center and a new theater in suburban Fairfax, Va., which is being built by George Mason University.</p>
        <p>''There's going to be competition for people's time, attention and resources,'' he said. ''Institutions like the Kennedy Center will have to redefine their constituency and role and look for other opportunities.''</p>
