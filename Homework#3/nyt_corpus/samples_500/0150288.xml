        <p>Banca Commerciale Italiana said that Italian regulators had indicated that they would approve its bid to buy 51 percent of the Irving Bank Corportion at $80 a share. The offer has the approval of Irving's management and directors and is competing with a hostile offer from the Bank of New York Company. Banca Commerciale's bid must still be approved by the Federal Reserve Board, which is expected to take several months.</p>
        <p>Irving's stock was unchanged yesterday at $62.375 a share, or slightly below the $64.81-a-share value of the Bank of New York's offer. The Bank of New York, whose stock rose 12.5 cents a share, to $31.625, is offering $15 cash and 1.575 of its shares for each Irving share.</p>
