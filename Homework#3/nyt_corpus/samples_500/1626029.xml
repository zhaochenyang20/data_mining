        <p>A collision between two trucks on the New Jersey Turnpike last night killed at least 22 sheep in one of the trucks and left others running along the turnpike in a panic, said a spokesman for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. The accident, which caused no human injuries, occurred about 11 p.m. in the northbound lanes near the interchange to Route 8A, said the spokesman, Joe Orlando, who said he did not know how the crash occurred. Animal control officers were called to help round up about 16 sheep that had escaped.</p>
