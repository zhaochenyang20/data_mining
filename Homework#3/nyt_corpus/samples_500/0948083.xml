        <p>IN contemporary culture, a sculpture no longer functions as an idol, and only rarely -- usually unsuccessfully -- as a monument.

        <p>IN contemporary culture, a sculpture no longer functions as an idol, and only rarely -- usually unsuccessfully -- as a monument. So what may appear to be a search for meaning in modern sculpture often turns out to involve a nostalgia for the devotional and memorial functions of which it has been unburdened, or robbed, depending on your point of view.</p>
        <p>It may be that the three sculptors whose work is gathered in ''Ancient Emblems, Contemporary Signifiers'' at the Jersey City Museum -- Marion E. Held, Ming Fay and Tova Beck-Friedman -- are motivated by that kind of nostalgia. Certainly that is the implication of the curator Alejandro Anreus's contention that ''all three look through the lens of so-called 'primitive' civilizations and myths to sharpen their vision and understanding of our own society.''</p>
        <p>Yet it is hard to tell how important this affinity for ancient myth really is for these artists' work. Lacking overt allusions to particular myths or rituals, their primitive resonances seem vague. Although Ms. Beck-Friedman, for instance, has said that her art ''is informed by archetypal images of the Feminine as expressed in ancient myths,'' it's hard to find anything particularly feminine or mythical in her group of five towering monoliths here. Rather, these upright, abstract forms, despite some echoes of human postures, are more reminiscent of trees or rock formations. Are we meant to think of old tales of metamorphoses, like that of Daphne, who became a laurel tree? Maybe. But these forms express stasis, not transformation.</p>
        <p>The dark gray, granular surface of these sculptures resembles granite, yet somehow it is immediately apparent to the eye that materially these volumes are somehow lighter, softer, less dense than might seem to be the case -- perhaps even hollow. And in fact they turn out to be made of pulped paper, not stone. Their title, ''Memory Imprints,'' suggests that they embody distant memories of sculptures past, of ancient stelae and ruined architectural fragments. Since any of those things would have been carved out of obdurate stone rather than molded from a friable, malleable material like paper, Ms. Beck-Friedman's sculpture poses the problem of its own lack of reality in comparison to its models, the sense that its recollection of the past may be no more than a fiction.</p>
        <p>This sense of unreality is even more explicit in the five works by Mr. Fay, highly detailed -- one might almost say hyper-real -- depictions of plant forms at much greater than actual size. At times these representations seem quite literal, as in two works effectively displayed hanging from the ceiling: ''Berries'' (1997) and ''Elixirs'' (1988), which is a pair of hairy root vegetables that could easily, aside from the change of scale, have come from the exotic offerings of a Chinatown vegetable market. But some of the others have an implicit air of science fiction about them: they might just be unfamiliar but quite real plants, yet they seem to be weird hybrids. Again, despite all the loving attention that has clearly been given to details of texture and color, these sculptures highlight their own unreality, not only through scale but also through devices like the holes in ''Curl Tusk'' (1987), which allow the viewer to glimpse the hollow interior and the underlying armature of the piece.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Beck-Friedman, Ms. Held uses natural forms abstractly, particularly a simple concave form, reminiscent of a turtle shell, that she makes in ashen stoneware. With variations, this same form appears again and again in her three sculptures here, sometimes open, often paired to create a cell-like structure that can in turn be combined into extended configurations. Despite attempts to endow these units with pathos -- ''Clear Tube'' (1996), with its implication of a being on life support, or ''Metal Crib 2'' (1997), with its implication of infantile helplessness -- they are simply not interesting enough to arouse empathy. Ms. Held's insistence on the shape (there can be dozens in a single work like ''Passages'') only magnifies the viewer's sense of its triviality.</p>
        <p>T HERE is something theatrically proplike about the work of all three sculptors, although in Ms. Beck-Friedman's and Mr. Fay's work the resulting ambiguities lend interest, even though they ultimately limit its power. All the more reason to appreciate the directness of ''Deception, Betrayal, Loss,'' the work of another sculptor, Chris Griffin, in the museum's West Gallery. Despite the portentous title, the work tells another story: cool, precise and light of touch, it teasingly flirts with sentimentality but knows just where to stop.</p>
        <p>Best in show here is 'The Garden'' (1997), in which a thick mass of colorful silk flowers is gathered in a paintinglike rectangle on the wall. To the right, almost eclipsed by its brightness, is a black veil or sheer scarf on which a grid of small white crosses appears. With its funereal implications, this smaller and less conspicuous element suddenly transforms the festive appearance of the silken garden: one suddenly realizes its proportions are about right for a cemetery plot. Ms. Griffin has contrived a neat, resonant interchange of extremes -- from joy to mourning and, perhaps, back again -- with a delight in the artifice of her means and no heavy rhetoric.</p>
        <p>Although not every piece is quite so successful, each has the merit of being quite distinct as well as concise in both its means and its implications. Unbeholden to a given form, format or material, this work offers multiplicity, not importunity. In ''Hands'' (1997), the plaster palms that stretch out from the wall proffer a seemingly random assortment of odd little trinkets -- a celestial blue marble with white stars inscribed on it, a wax nipple, a cagelike wire-mesh house -- as if to say that art itself is a simple gesture of ostension, like the one by which the martyred saints in old painting serenely exhibit the instruments of their torment.</p>
