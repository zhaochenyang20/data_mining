        <p>A COMPANY that goes for some time without a chief financial officer may be raising a red flag for investors.</p>
        <p>The average search for a chief financial officer takes three to four months, according to Lee Pomeroy a consultant at Egon Zehnder International, an executive search firm.

        <p>A COMPANY that goes for some time without a chief financial officer may be raising a red flag for investors.</p>
        <p>The average search for a chief financial officer takes three to four months, according to Lee Pomeroy a consultant at Egon Zehnder International, an executive search firm. A quest that drags on longer than that can indicate that things are ''structurally wrong'' within the company, he said.</p>
        <p>Candidates for a corporation's top financial job, of course, may balk for any number of reasons. They may be dissatisfied with the compensation, the degree of authority or the chain of command. But sometimes the issues are ones that also concern investors: management's corporate strategy, the abilities of the chief executive or the strength of the company's business.</p>
        <p>That's why some analysts have been looking somewhat warily at Electronic Data Systems and Nike, two companies that have been without chief financial officers for more than seven months.</p>
        <p>Both companies have struggled as the global financial turmoil saps their revenues, and the price of both their stocks have suffered.</p>
        <p>Shares of Electronic Data, also known as E.D.S., are down more than 11 percent for the year. Yesterday, they closed at $38.9375, down 31.25 cents. Class B shares of Nike are up 7 percent for the year, but down more than 20 percent since July. They closed at $41.8125 yesterday, up 43.75 cents.</p>
        <p>E.D.S. says its search for a finance chief has been put on hold until a new chief executive is found. Nike is now on its second search firm for a chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>While business slowdowns are investors' primary concern, the continued absence of finance chiefs does not help foster confidence in the two companies, analysts said.</p>
        <p>Greg Gieber, senior equity analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, said that E.D.S. needed stronger internal financial controls and a finance chief who would enact them quickly. That, he said, would enable the company to improve its ability to forecast earnings.</p>
        <p>''Some of the earnings surprises were surprises to senior management as well,'' Mr. Gieber said. ''One thing I want to hear a C.F.O. saying is, 'We now have our internal reporting structure under control.' ''</p>
        <p>Such comments reflect the rising importance of chief financial officers as their role has grown in recent years: they help orchestrate turnarounds of troubled companies, identify and negotiate mergers and acquisitions and plan spinoffs.</p>
        <p>''The chief financial officer is the second most important person'' in a company, said Randall S. Peterson, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management.</p>
        <p>The chief executive is primarily responsible for setting a company's strategic direction, but the chief financial officer is usually responsible for the day-to-day financial activities and can play a major role in communicating corporate strategies and progress to shareholders, said Stephen Gates, a principal researcher for the Conference Board.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a Conference Board study of the stock performance of 300 companies in the last three years found that companies whose shares outperformed those of their rivals usually had a chief financial officer who spent more than 20 percent of his or her time assisting executives with forming business strategies.</p>
        <p>Deborah C. Hopkins, who was named as the new chief financial officer at the Boeing Company on Monday, is a good example of the type of finance chief many companies now seek.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hopkins, formerly the finance chief of European operations for the General Motors Corporation, has overseen risk-management programs and developed programs that aided G.M.'s international growth. Prior to that, she helped turn around the troubled Unisys Corporation. Before Boeing's announcement, Ms. Hopkins had been considered a top candidate to fill the post at E.D.S.</p>
        <p>As demand for top finance executives rises, so does their compensation. Last year, the average compensation of chief financial officers, including the value of stock options, rose to more than $4 million, up 83 percent from the previous year.</p>
        <p>The star power of some finance chiefs is sometimes illustrated by how the market reacts to their departures or arrivals. Jerome B. York earned such a strong reputation for his cost-cutting ways as chief financial officer of I.B.M. that when he left in September 1995, the company's shares tumbled nearly 2 percent in a session during which other computer stocks rose.</p>
        <p>In the case of Nike, the world's largest athletic footwear company, Robert Falcone, who had held the post for six years, resigned in January. Nike has suffered from declining sales in the United States and abroad. Hiring a chief financial officer, analysts say, could indicate that Nike is serious about making changes and improving its profitability.</p>
        <p>''It's a crucial role, especially in a turnaround,'' Faye Landes, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said.</p>
        <p>For example, Nike's expenses and inventory controls might get more attention from a chief financial officer. ''Many people would like Nike to take a very strong look at expenses,'' she said. ''The company has always been able to grow into expenses, but it's dealing with a much smaller growth rate.''</p>
        <p>Many of Nike's problems in recent months can be traced to swollen inventory, caused by a sales slowdown in Asia and waning popularity of some styles.</p>
        <p>''It might also be prudent for the company to look at how it forecasts,'' Ms. Landes said. ''They forecast better than anybody in the industry, but it might not be good enough.''</p>
        <p>Jeff Cava, Nike's vice president for global human resources, conceded that the search had ''certainly taken longer than we had hoped.''</p>
        <p>He said that Nike had had the greatest difficulty in attracting candidates whose families were willing to relocate to its corporate headquarters in Beaverton, Ore.</p>
        <p>''We're a special company with a special culture and fit is as important as the technical qualifications,'' Mr. Cava said. ''Our process is probably a little more rigorous.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 21, 1998, Saturday  The Market Place column in Business Day yesterday, about companies that have not filled the post of chief financial officer in many months, misstated the reason for a recent slowdown at one such company, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation. Its earnings have suffered from cost-cutting by customers, particularly the General Motors Corporation, not from the global financial turmoil.</p>
