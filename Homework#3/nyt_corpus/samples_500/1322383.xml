        <p>The Jets signed defensive tackle Steve Martin today. He was among Kansas City's final cuts last weekend, and the Jets hope he can help plug the considerable hole in their run defense created by the loss of Jason Ferguson.</p>
        <p>Martin (6 feet 4 inches, 319 pounds) will have three days of practice to get ready for Sunday's season opener against the Indianapolis Colts, although James Reed, a rookie, had been told over the weekend that he would start the game. The Jets gave Martin, 27, a one-year deal that is worth a little more than $600,000 including incentives. At the same time, they put Ferguson on injured reserve, which officially ends his season.</p>

        <p>The Jets signed defensive tackle Steve Martin today. He was among Kansas City's final cuts last weekend, and the Jets hope he can help plug the considerable hole in their run defense created by the loss of Jason Ferguson.</p>
        <p>Martin (6 feet 4 inches, 319 pounds) will have three days of practice to get ready for Sunday's season opener against the Indianapolis Colts, although James Reed, a rookie, had been told over the weekend that he would start the game. The Jets gave Martin, 27, a one-year deal that is worth a little more than $600,000 including incentives. At the same time, they put Ferguson on injured reserve, which officially ends his season.</p>
        <p>''You have to be able to walk in the door and play,'' Martin said. ''I did it in Philadelphia three years ago. Over the years, you get used to that kind of stuff. I think it's something I can adapt to quickly. It's a pretty basic defense, very similar to defenses I've run in the past.''</p>
        <p>Martin, who is in his sixth season, was a reserve last year for the Chiefs, where Terry Bradway was vice president of player personnel before he joined the Jets as general manager. Martin had 27 tackles and 17 quarterback pressures. He started 15 games in 1999 for Philadelphia and had 60 tackles, 2 sacks, 6 quarterback pressures and 2 forced fumbles. His release from Kansas City was something of a surprise -- he had started each of their preseason games -- and he recently bought a home there because he plans to settle down in Missouri, where he went to college, when he retires. Bradway said he received calls from Chiefs Coach Dick Vermeil and from the team's president, Carl Peterson, endorsing Martin.</p>
        <p>''It was definitely a shock to me,'' Martin said of being cut by Kansas City. ''I didn't see it coming. They told me the younger guys may not be ready early on, but over the course of time will be better suited to what they're trying to do with the defense there.''</p>
        <p>The Jets made the decision on Martin fast. For meetings this morning, they brought in Tim Morabito, who was recently waived by the Carolina Panthers, Ernie Logan, the former Jets nose tackle, and Martin. The Jets did not meet with Russell Maryland, 32, who was released Sunday by Green Bay, and Bradway said Maryland's age and recent back trouble were factors.</p>
        <p>The Jets' choice really came down to Martin and Morabito, because both had played during the preseason and were in football shape. Logan was not in any team's training camp and would not have been ready to play immediately. By 3 p.m., the Jets had their new nose tackle, and Martin was planning to spend the evening in defensive meetings and preparing to face Indianapolis, the team with which he began his career. An hour after signing Martin, the Jets waived Maurice Anderson, who was second on the depth chart to Reed and who had started two preseason games. That could clear the way for the Jets to bring in another nose tackle, a possibility Bradway held open today.</p>
        <p>''He's a good addition to our team,'' Coach Herman Edwards said of Martin. ''He's familiar in that he has played in this conference before. We figure that he'll help in the development of James Reed. He is strong at the point of attack. He's a durable player, with starting experience.''</p>
        <p>Bradway said Martin could play the nose or the three-technique tackle position that Shaun Ellis occupies. Martin said his best quality is being able to take on the double team, something with which Reed has struggled. ''They needed some more experience inside,'' Martin said. ''The young guy certainly has the ability to do the job. He just doesn't have the experience. I'm ready to go for 16 games.''</p>
        <p>Before Martin signed, Reed said he was trying not to be bothered by talk that a veteran could soon supplant him.</p>
        <p>''It's not a distraction to me,'' Reed said. ''When I get in there, I'll make the best of the opportunity.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Punter TOM TUPA said Monday that his hip flexor felt good, and that he would try to punt Wednesday, for the first time since before the Giants game 10 days ago. Tupa, who did not punt in any preseason game because of lingering soreness in his hip flexor, said he should definitely be ready to go for the second game of the season, in Oakland, but will not punt Sunday. Tupa said he punted so much trying to break the scar tissue from his off-season hernia surgery that he strained his hip flexor. ''It's frustrating,'' Tupa said. ''The whole goal was to get over the surgery, and then this pops up.''. . . General Manager TERRY BRADWAY said that because the Jets have other needs, they will not bring offensive lineman JUMBO ELLIOTT back right now. . . . Linebacker JASON GLENN, a rookie who is cornerback AARON GLENN's younger brother, was claimed off waivers by the Jets. He was released Sunday by Detroit. Aaron is 5-9, 185 pounds. Jason is 6 feet, 231 pounds. . . . The Jets put tight end DANIEL WILCOX, quarterback TORY WOODBURY, center/guard TUPE PIKO, running back MARLION JACKSON  and defensive tackle GIRADIE MERCER to their practice squad.</p>
