        <p>Disquiet pervaded Dance Theater Workshop Wednesday night, in works by Mollie O'Brien and the choreographic team known as robbinschilds (Sonya Robbins and Layla Childs).</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Brien's ''This is what I would have felt,'' choreographed in collaboration with members of her company, MOB Productions, began with Jennifer Dignan methodically picking up squares of white tissue from the stage. Gina Jacobs entered, nervously tugging at her hair and rubbing her legs. Kate Garroway and Donna Costello followed her in choreography that marked contrasting states of rigidity and floppiness to a melancholy score by Shawn Onsgard for Alex Weinstein, a guitarist, and Ken Thomson, on clarinet and saxophone.</p>
        <p>The characters often seemed befuddled. At other times, they swung their arms compulsively. The four women appeared anxious and, possibly, ill. They scrutinized each other as if conducting medical examinations, muttered incomprehensibly and burst into inexplicable tears. The work ended with pieces of tissue raining down upon the stage.</p>
        <p>Something obviously ailed these women. But the audience never learned what it was. Nor did the choreography allow any of the dancers to disclose their troubles to anyone else. Instead, the dance communicated how difficult it is for people to communicate. And it communicated that message quite effectively. But because it did, you wished Ms. O'Brien might go on and communicate something more.</p>
        <p>Other mystifications filled ''half space,'' by robbinschilds, to a sonic collage by Dan Crane and Rosten Woo. The space was dominated by a glittering chandelier, a mountain of rugs and a stack of piled-up chairs. Michael Helland unrolled rugs with his feet. Ms. Childs and Ms. Robbins rolled around the stage like human rugs, never rising from the floor. Leslie Kraus danced an abrupt duet with Mr. Helland that ended with him hoisting her atop the chairs. There was a more languid duet for Rachael Faulkner and Mr. Helland, and a trio of forced jollity for all three of those dancers.</p>
        <p>But for all this movement, their exertions accomplished little dramatically.</p>
        <p>The performance continues through tomorrow night at Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077.</p>
