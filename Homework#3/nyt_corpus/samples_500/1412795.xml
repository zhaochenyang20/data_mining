        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* ''THE AGE OF IMPRESSIONISM: EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE ORDRUPGAARD COLLECTION, COPENHAGEN,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 8). Said to be the most important holding of 19th-century French paintings in northern Europe, the Ordrupgaard Collection was assembled in the early 20th century by Wilhelm Hansen (1868-1936), a Danish insurance magnate. With works in depth by Gauguin, Degas, Pissarro, Monet, Renoir and Sisley and treasures by Manet, Matisse, Cézanne and others, the collection, now owned by the state, is ensconced at Hansen's former country home outside Copenhagen, along with a fine group of paintings by Danish artists of Hansen's day and earlier. At the Met, the Danish and French collections are shown in separate galleries. The larger French section has true delights, among them a lively Fauve still life by Matisse from 1909, a rare Polynesian-flavored Gauguin portrait of 1896 and a great Pissarro representation, including a powerful evocation of springtime painted at his home in Éragny, France, in 1894. The most interesting of the Danish artists is Vilhelm Hammershoi, the last of the great 19th-century Danish painters, whose spare, somber interiors and portraits -- untouched by modernism -- have recently returned to critical consciousness. Altogether, the 84 paintings make a real banquet. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>''AMERICAN ANTHEM: MASTERWORKS FROM THE AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM,'' 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040 (through Jan. 5). The last in a trio of shows celebrating the American Folk Art Museum's new building, ''Anthem'' displays more than 250 objects from among those acquired since the museum began 40 years ago. And in the museum's cleverly designed new digs, the show really comes on strong. It displays some of folk art's most esteemed icons, among them the ''Flag Gate,'' a weathered farm gate of painted wood in the shape of an American flag; a pair of spiffy lady-gentleman portraits by Ammi Phillips; a spirited carousel horse from Coney Island carved by Charles Carmel; and a life-size baseball player at bat, carved by Samuel Anderson Robb. For the first time, too, the show includes the work of 20th-century self-taught artists in context with earlier folk art in the collection. Also for the first time, the museum demonstrates its recently expanded collecting interests beyond the United States, showing the work of 20th-century self-taught Europeans like Adolf Wolfli, Madge Gill and Carlo Zinelli. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $5, students and 62+ (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* ''DAVID TO CÉZANNE: 19TH-CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS,'' Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Sept. 8). With this exciting show, the Morgan, best known for the excellence of its Dutch and Flemish works on paper, makes its first large-scale foray into 19th-century French drawings. The 106 works trace the last hurrah of the academic tradition and the dazzling drawing skills it spawned through several generations of extraordinary talent and artistic innovations, from Neo-Classicism to the doorstep of Neo-Impressionism. The works have been selected and installed with an eye to fascinating comparisons and drawing's diverse mediums and uses. Giants like Ingres, Degas, Delacroix and Cézanne are generously represented, but some wonderful unknowns like Charles Damour and Léon Bonvin (the creator of a heavenly little twig-by-twig farm scene) are also introduced. Within the blur of versatility and mutating styles, nearly every work establishes its own still point, and one of drawing's golden ages is vividly evoked. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''THOMAS EAKINS,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 15). It remains nearly impossible to see America, or at least to look back on the country in the 19th century, without some refraction through Eakins's art. He painted, hands down, the finest 19th-century American painting, ''The Gross Clinic,'' which by itself justifies leaving your home right now and visiting the Met. His sentiments always ran deep below the surface, but they bubbled up in ways even he didn't necessarily seem to realize, or didn't want to acknowledge. The strong current of homoeroticism throughout his work is the obvious example. The show comes with two discoveries: that Eakins occasionally projected photographs with the aid of a magic lantern and traced the projections; and that he often began paintings by putting down bright colors, but then added subtle glazes of brown or black to give the pictures evenness and sobriety, a process overlooked or misunderstood by restorers in the past. Both discoveries help us see afresh this classic figure, who seems as interesting for being uneven and unpredictable as he is for his familiar commitment to unvarnished reality. His most American quality, in the end, may not be his scientific sensibility or pioneering choice of subjects or any other cliché of nationalism, but this combination of dogged, plain-spoken, almost puritanical realism with a simmering, unconventional character. Hours and admission: See above (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''GAUGUIN IN NEW YORK COLLECTIONS: THE LURE OF THE EXOTIC,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Oct. 20). The first major New York exhibition devoted to Gauguin in four decades isn't major-major by Met blockbuster standards: more than half of the 120 pieces are drawings and prints. But these are pretty spectacular, and they are joined by some two dozen paintings, including coral-and-mango-colored visions of a mythical South Pacific that are among the most beautiful images created by any modern artist. Only the Met has the resources to put this kind of material together, though if you want to get a real sense of the not-so-nice artist himself, check out the new critical biography by Nancy Mowll Mathews, ''Paul Gauguin: An Erotic Life.'' Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''FRIDA KAHLO, DIEGO RIVERA AND 20TH-CENTURY MEXICAN ART: THE JACQUES AND NATASHA GELMAN COLLECTION,'' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272 (through Sept. 8). El Museo began in an East Harlem storefront; now it's a capstone of Museum Mile with a show that many a larger, richer museum would welcome. Kahlo is a big part of the attraction. Seven of her self-portraits are here, reason enough for a pilgrimage. Sure, she's been oversold, but she's great. Her husband, Diego Rivera, looks good, too, with his visionary ''Calla Lily Vendor'' and a slinky portrait of Natasha Gelman that is pure tinseltown luxe. There are, in fact, too many Gelman portraits on hand, along with some other second-tier work, but with so much else of interest the show is a must-see even for museumgoers who usually stick to the mainstream. Those for whom Kahlo is the She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed of modernist painting are no doubt lining up at the door. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $3 for students and 65+ (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''MEXICO CITY: AN EXHIBITION ABOUT THE EXCHANGE RATES OF BODIES AND VALUES,'' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through September). Mexico City has an extremely happening art scene. This exhibition of largely conceptual pieces by 17 young artists either born or based there looks sparse and uneven as it has been installed, but it is full of interesting -- in one case deeply disturbing and ethically challenging -- work. Anyone expecting an upbeat, fiesta atmosphere will be disappointed: the predominant subjects here are poverty, decay and human predation, with moments of tenderness and humor glinting through. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+ (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''MOVING PICTURES,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue at 88th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 12). This survey of photography appended with a small selection of video, film and installation art may be the largest exhibition at its kind in a major New York museum. Drawn almost entirely from the Guggenheim's permanent collection, it has a snappy yet unobtrusive design by Hani Rashid and capably surveys the expansion of contemporary art by various camera-dependent media from the late 1960's to the present. It begins with works by Nam June Paik, Bruce Naumann and Robert Smithson, then moves up the museum's ramp through photographs by Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and Andreas Gursky, concluding with video and film by artists like Stan Douglas, Shirin Neshat and Pierre Huyghe. An added attraction are the foam-lined, cave-like video galleries perched at the top of the spiral, which give the show a giddy, Hall-of-the-Mountain-King finale that seems to say ''onward and upward with video.'' Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $9, students and 65+ (Smith)</p>
        <p>* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, QUEENS, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400. The Modern's new temporary home (until 2005) has finally opened in the former Swingline staple factory with part of its permanent collection of paintings and sculpture on view along with a few summer shows, including a contemporary survey called ''Tempo.'' The galleries approximate the classic industrial loft aesthetic, efficient and airless, like the inside of a storage center, which is exactly what this building is, but touching for Cézannes, Seurats and Braques, which suddenly look fresh and by contrast seem to pop off the movable bare white walls. The shows include ''Autobodies,'' five gorgeous automobiles from the museum's collection, and a display of Rudy Burckhardt's little-known photographs of Queens in the late 1930's and early 40's, a perfect tribute to the museum's new locale. ''Tempo,'' a wide-ranging, global-minded, erratically engaging and fuzzily conceived effort, is supposed to have something to do with movement, change, impermanence, the museum's migration and modernism's condition. It's all vague, but approached modestly it's fine, with good art and bad. The trip to the museum couldn't be easier on the No. 7 subway. Now you can tell everyone you're chic. You've been to Queens. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; to 7:45 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+ (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''CLAES OLDENBURG DRAWINGS, 1959-77'' AND ''CLAES OLDENBURG WITH COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN DRAWINGS, 1992-98,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Sept. 15). One of the most original draftsmen around is Claes Oldenburg, whose early sculptures of everyday objects in the 1960's helped to define the Pop art movement. His startling ability to perceive subtle visual relationships among objects and to morph them from one incarnation or state to another is on view in 92 drawings now owned by the Whitney, including 18 done in collaboration with his wife, Coosje van Bruggen. The show is said to be the largest ever mounted of Mr. Oldenberg's works on paper. The drawings, anthropomorphic, often erotic and always full of life, are brilliantly rendered in the cheerfully loose yet energetic Oldenburg style that gives inanimate objects a kind of body language, or attitude, if you will. He is at the top of his form in the proposals for monuments he began in the 1960's, like the gigantic ironing board looming over the Lower East Side of Manhattan (1965) and the cathedral in the form of a colossal faucet for Lake Union, Seattle (1972). But altogether the show is a fine celebration of the Oldenburg wizardry in extracting the extraordinary from the everyday. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''THE PAINTINGS OF JOAN MITCHELL,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Sept. 29). The impact of Mitchell's works, especially the later ones (she died of lung cancer 10 years ago, at 66), is so immediately intoxicating that a natural reaction is to distrust the art. Abstract paintings this suave and sure-footed must be glib and manipulative, you may be excused for telling yourself. Distrust your distrust. Lush, opulent fields of colors, seemingly all paradisiacal, contain shades of melancholy that reveal themselves to you after your eyes adjust to their light. Mitchell absorbed the influences of Pollock, Gorky, Kline and de Kooning. There are ferocious paintings of clotted splatters in the 1950's. Then hovering shapes appear in muted green, gray and blue in the 60's. They give way by the early 70's to more vividly colored multipanel paintings in which increasing varieties of shapes and lines jostle. Mitchell, who had moved to France, denied the influence of Monet, which was undeniable. Her last works, from the 80's and early 90's, push Monet into the late 20th century, ecstatically. Hours and admission: See above. Other Mitchell shows are at Cheim &amp; Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727, through Aug. 16; Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, Suite 308, SoHo, (212) 941-0012, through Aug. 16; and Edward Tyler Nahem Fine Art, at 56 East 66th Street, (212) 517-2453, through next Friday (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''SCANDIA: IMPORTANT EARLY MAPS OF THE NORTHERN REGIONS AND MAPS AND CHARTS OF NORWAY FROM THE COLLECTION OF WILLIAM B. AND INGER G. GINSBERG,'' Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, near 38th Street, (212) 879-9779 (through Aug. 16). This beautiful exhibition of 76 maps, small atlases and sea charts moves from late-15th-century woodblock maps based on Ptolemy to magnificently detailed late-18th-century maps of southern Norway and concludes with a series of elegant sea charts of the Norwegian coast, crenellated with fjords. Representing some of cartography's greatest names -- including Mercator, Blaeu and Ortelius -- it traces the northward progress of map-making expertise, commerce and political autonomy. Above all, it gloriously reflects the always mobile knowledge of the unceasing wonders and challenges of the natural world. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m. Free (Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''SPLENDID ISOLATION: ART OF EASTER ISLAND,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 8). The colossal stone heads that put tiny Easter Island on the map were not the only art produced by this isolated Polynesian community, as this show is out to demonstrate. The 50 or so works, from the 13th to 19th centuries, include not only one of the impassive stone heads but also smaller refined figures of carved and polished wood, painted bark cloth personages, feather headdresses, ornamental collars, clubs, dance paddles and rare inscribed tablets known as rongorongo. The business of Rapa Nui (the island's Polynesian name) carvers was to make figures giving body to the island's cosmology of gods, spirits and ancestral chiefs; the images contain their mana, or supernatural power. Among the important artifacts here are elegantly carved figures of the important god MakeMake as a mix of human and avian. He was a source of inspiration for 20th-century Surrealists. If the works don't match the intensity and expressive power of some of the African art in the Michael C. Rockefeller wing, they still give a splendid idea of a rich culture that thrived in isolation. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>''BLUE + WHITE = RADICAL,'' Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205 (through Aug. 9). The centuries-old tradition of blue and white porcelain lends itself to the purposes of contemporary ironists. The exhibition includes Delft-style hand grenades by Charles Krafft; plates by Paul Scott, bearing blue chain-link fence pattern over the image of a prisoner at Camp X-Ray; a surrealistic, quasi-scientific ''Semen Sampler'' by Cindy Kolodziejski; an elegant play with Chinese style in the form of a nonfunctional teapot by Leopold Foulem; and tile works by Hugo Kaagman that play with the iconography of 20th-century progress (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>ALFONSO OSSORIO, ''HORROR VACUI''; CLIFFORD ODETS, ''PARADISE LOST,'' Michael Rosenfeld, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082 (through Aug. 9). Ossorio was a sophisticated friend of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning whose art looked like the work of a half-mad outsider. This fascinating retrospective shows him to have been a gifted draftsman and a Surrealistic assemblagist with a great feel for decorative design. Odets, the famous playwright, found relief from insomnia and writer's block by painting small pictures on paper. The charming surfaces have dark undercurrents, as in the scarily distorted head called ''Punitive Parent'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''SUMMER,'' James Cohan, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 755-7171 (through Sept. 1). This appealingly varied seasonal show includes an extraordinary, magically realistic head of a pink, hairless ape by Erick Swenson; red, machine-generated plastic blobs by Roxy Paine; a lightly penciled wall drawing by Sol LeWitt; finely etched prints by Inka Essenhigh and Vija Celmins; and, by Fred Tomaselli, another visually captivating exercise in pharmacological excess (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>JAN VERCRUYSSE, ''Camera Oscura,'' Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212) 925-4338 (through Aug. 31). The minor joke of Mr. Vercruysse's new series of photographs, called ''Camera Oscura,'' might take a moment to get. In each diptych, a person in costume (a girl dressed as one of ''Las Meninas,'' a man with a Duchampian bottle rack) appears standing normally on one side and doing a handstand on the other. It's a wry play on the fact that a real camera obscura creates an inverted virtual image of reality (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''WHERE IS ELVIS? THE MAN AND HIS REFLECTIONS,'' Howard Greenberg Gallery, 120 Wooster Street, (212) 334-0010 (through Aug. 16). This year is the 25th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death in 1977 at 42, a cause for this far-flung and upbeat roundup of nearly 75 photos shot at various times by different photographers. Elvis kissing Mom, Elvis in the Army, Elvis and his Cadillac, Elvis on his Harley, Elvis and his fans, Elvis and his dates, Elvis doing ''Blue Suede Shoes'' with the Dorsey brothers, Elvis's gold piano, Elvis imitators (including Jerry Seinfeld), Elvis with the blues guitarist B. B. King and a lineup of Elvis dolls all figure in these works by photographers like Norma Bergsma, David Byrne, William Eggleston, Marvin Israel and Alfred Wertheimer. Perhaps the most poignant is a 1956 action shot by Roger Marshutz taken in Tupelo, Miss., which shows the powerful communion between the icon and his fans as he straddles the microphone to belt out a song, touching their outstretched hands with his own. Take heart, Elvis seekers. As long as photography lives, old superstars will never fade away (Glueck).</p>
        <p>ERNEST WITHERS, ''Memphis,'' Gallery 292, 120 Wooster Street, (212) 431-0292 (through Aug. 16). Born in 1922, Mr. Withers is not only an eminent photojournalist but was also one of the first African-American policemen in Memphis. This engaging small exhibition includes wonderful early pictures of performers like B. B. King, James Brown and Ike and Tina Turner in action at local clubs, civil rights scenes like the funeral march for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a somber picture of Jackie Robinson and fellow players (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>* ''AMERICAN STANDARD: (PARA)NORMALITY AND EVERYDAY LIFE,'' Barbara Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300 (through Aug. 16). The photographer Gregory Crewdson has gathered 22 works, in each of which something uncanny lurks beneath the banal surface of suburban existence. Photographs, paintings and sculptures by Edward Hopper, Diane Arbus, Bill Owens, Robert Gober, Vija Celmins, John Currin and others hint at how unconscious energies impinge on ordinary ego consciousness and mirror, perhaps, a society yearning for divine revelation (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''BYSTANDER,'' Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-5450 (through Aug. 23). John Connelly, a young New York dealer with his eyes wide open, has assembled this spicy selection of eight young photographers, some familiar, others just starting to make their marks. A seemingly unstudied, snapshot aesthetic prevails. The work breaks down into traditional genres like landscape (Christina Hejtmanek's views of the American West through rain-streaked car windows) and still life (Pete Riesett, shots of suburban dining room china cabinets). But the human figure is the center of attention for Kelly Lamb, Dean Sameshina, Ryan McGinley and Amy Steiner, who has a lovely ceiling piece. (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''EROTIKA,'' Riva, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 242-3434 (through Aug. 10). Surrealism and then Pop Art opened fine art to pornography, and now sexual explicitness is almost tiresomely ubiquitous. Still, this show has interesting moments, including the Chapman Brothers' hilariously offensive video starring two porn actresses and a mannequin's head; Kiki Seror's illuminated, digitally generated sex-chat text; Andres Serrano's portrait of a naked woman and her bovine object of desire; and a modest picture of a woman in a car by the usually over-the-top David LaChapelle (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ANDREW GRASSIE, ''Sculptures,'' Paul Morris, 465 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-2752 (through Aug. 20). Mr. Grassie paints lovely small copies of photographs of 60's-style Modernist sculptures -- classic works by Tony Smith, John Chamberlain, Donald Judd and others. Up close you discover that the apparent photographic transparency has a subtle, painterly materialism, and you can appreciate the artist's Vermeerish touch. Conceptually, the paintings are like a nerd's revenge on former campus bullies (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''GROUP SHOW,'' Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183 (through Aug. 30). This well-selected and installed exhibition includes Julian Opie's Neo-Pop landscapes, which look like children's book illustrations; Craig Kauffman's sensuous, baby blue plastic doughnut; Richard Deacon's metal sculptures, resembling flattened pillows; a large Minimalist panel of thin mirror strips by John Armleder; and the image of an inflatable flower converted into a flat, shiny stainless steel cutout by Jeff Koons (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* KATHLEEN JOHNSON, ''The Smallest Wonder,'' Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159 (through Aug. 9.) Shimmering, wavy lines of light cascade down blue, underwater swimming pool steps in Ms. Johnson's large-format, panoramic photographs. The transformation of something so ordinary to something almost mystically radiant is exhilarating (Johnson).</p>
        <p>JASON ODDY; JIN MEYERSON, Frederieke Taylor Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-0992 (through Aug. 9). Mr. Oddy, a photographic investigator, presents large color pictures shot in cryonic facilities where human bodies are deep frozen for possible future revival. His oblique images of institutional spaces and scientific equipment are less chilling than you might expect. Mr. Meyerson makes engaging, swirly semiabstract paintings in which one discovers distorted images of American football players (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''SOMETHING, ANYTHING,'' Matthew Marks, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200 (through Aug. 16). This gallery's artist-organized summer exhibitions have all been outstanding, and this one, put together by Nayland Blake, is no exception. It's an almost-all-American extravaganza that Ping-Pongs back and forth between the sublime and the abject, and the lineup of artists is, to say the least, eclectic. It includes oddball modernists (Gaston Lachaise, Betty Parsons, H. C. Westermann), folk artists (Bill Traylor), cartoonists (Ernie Bushmiller, George Herriman), contemporary stars (Cindy Sherman, Mike Kelley) and interesting younger figures like Chris Johanson, John deFazio, Christian Marclay and Katharina Frisch. It makes all of them look like Outsider artists, doing work that is both fanatically crafted and conceptually out there beyond the fringe. Mr. Blake also contributes an installation of 3,000 record albums from his personal collection and a turntable to play them on (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>YOSHITAKA AMANO, Leo Koenig, 249 Centre Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 334-9255 (through tomorrow). A superstar of Japanese anime, Mr. Amano is the creator of ''Speed Racer,'' ''G-Force'' and ''Final Fantasy.'' This show features glossy, cartoon portraits of androgynous young action heroes and a near mural-size painting crammed with every ''Final Fantasy'' character. Best is a series of brush and ink paintings on paper, each representing a different emotionally excited human eye (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* OLAF BREUNING, ''Hello Darkness,'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035 (through tomorrow). Though considerably racier, the tableau that Mr. Breuning has produced here is a lot like what you see in the front yards of creative suburbanites on Halloween. After passing through a ruined library, you come upon the primal scene, illuminated by spinning and strobing colored lights: a skeleton conversing with an extraordinarily realistic sex doll lounging in a deluxe coffin. It's ludicrous but briefly gripping (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CHARLA, June Kelly, 591 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 226-1660 (through today). This one-name artist begins her paintings by rubbing canvases applied to trees, rocks and other natural surfaces. In the studio, the artist develops the textures in paint, creating, at best, subtly colored abstractions of delicate and ethereal luminosity (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''GREUZE THE DRAFTSMAN,'' Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Sunday). Unlike Watteau, Fragonard and Boucher, Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725-1805) does not have a name that rings bells. Yet as a dramatist in painting, he stands very high, and as a draftsman, he stands higher still. A lifelong champion of Greuze is Edgar Munhall, the chief curator emeritus of the Frick Collection, and he organized this exhibition of roughly 70 drawings to spectacular effect. They cover the gamut of Greuze's career, from his days as a student in Paris to the self-portrait that he sent to the Paris Salon the year before he died. Both the catalog and the show are majestic achievements. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students and 62+ (John Russell).</p>
        <p>CARLOS MÉRIDA, Ramis Barquet, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-9090 (through today). Mérida, the Modernist painter, was born in Guatemala in 1891, studied in Paris and lived most of his life in Mexico City. This small retrospective follows his evolution across eight decades from a Picasso-influenced 1915 portrait of a woman to playful, mid-century grid compositions to a Cubist quartet devoted to the four seasons made three years before the artist's death at 93 (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RICHARD SHARPE SHAVER, ''Weird and Wonderful Art,'' Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 462-2668 (through today). Less an artist than a man possessed by nutty ideas, Shaver (1907-1975) believed that images suggested by seemingly natural patterns on ordinary rocks proved the existence of titans who lived on earth before human beings. This exhibition presents a selection of Shaver's quasi-scientific rock photographs, examples of his writings and paintings teeming with blond, red-lipped figures shaded and textured so that they look as though carved from stone (Johnson).</p>
